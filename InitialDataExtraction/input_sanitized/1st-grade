Looking at his early life and education, Wells explores Shakespeare's social and intellectual background and the literary traditions on which Shakespeare drew. Examining the theatres and theatrical profession of the time, he also considers how Shakespeare experienced this world, both as an actor and as a writer. Examining Shakespeare's narrative poems, sonnets, and all of his plays, Wells outlines their sources, style, and originality over the course of Shakespeare's career, to consider the fundamental impact his work has had for subsequent generations. Written with enthusiasm and flair by a scholar who has devoted a lifetime to the study of Shakespeare and his works, this is an engaging and authoritative introduction.

The foundational basis for this study is two sets of manuscript sources that highlight two distinct yet connected experiences of women as participants in the criminal process. One consists of a collection of archival documents from the first half of the seventeenth century, a corpus called 'querelas,' in which formal accusations of criminal acts were registered. This is a rich source of information not only about the types of crimes reported, but also the process that plaintiffs had to follow to deal with their cases. The second primary source consists of a sampling of documents known as the ‘perdão de parte.’ The term refers to the victim’s pardon, unique to the Iberian Peninsula, which allowed individuals implicated in serious conflicts to have a voice in the judicial process. By looking at a sample of these pardons, found in notary collections from the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, Abreu-Ferreira is able to show the extent to which women exercised their agency in a legal process that was otherwise male-dominated.", 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9781472442338', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=umjVBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=umjVBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '1472442334', 'pageCount': 250, 'authors': ['Darlene Abreu-Ferreira'], 'id': 'umjVBgAAQBAJ'}, {'categories': ['Travel'], 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=DZl4BwAAQBAJ&dq=17th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'publisher': 'Enrico Massetti Publishing', 'subtitle': '', 'title': 'Rome Wine Trails', 'description': 'This e-guide covers a visit to the wine region around Rome: the "Castelli Romani", with visits to Zagarolo, Montecompatri, Frascati, Marino, Colli Albani, Colli Lanuvini, Velletri.

All were proposed in the seventeenth century by Théophraste Renaudot, who felt they were necessary to meet the new social realities of the time. With the support of Cardinal Richelieu he was able to attack the problem of poverty in a new way by setting up the Bureau d'Adresse, which grew from an employment agency to a clearing- house for many social services, including free medical care. The discussions that were held there made it the most popular academy in Europe and the forerunner of the Académie Françise. At the same time Renaudot was editing and publishing the Gazette, an important instrument of government propaganda. Howard M. Solomon considers each aspect of Renaudot's multi-dimensional career and examines the relationship between his activities and the needs and methods of the ministries of Richelieu and Mazarin. While they had Richelieu's support all his novel schemes flourished, but only the Gazette survived the Cardinal's death. Originally published in 1972.

The pioneering work of the Company's factors, the administrative mechanism evolved by the supple and shrewd Directors of the English East India Company, the plantation of English factories in the heart of India, and the interesting problems that developed inevitably out of their contact with the Moghuls, have all been discussed by previous writers. Mr. William Foster's monumental work on the English Factories in India, Sir William Hunters History of British India, and Professor W. R. Scott's Constitution and Finance of English etc. Joint-Stock Companies have thrown a flood of light on the leading events in the early history of the East India Company. Of the earlier writers, it is sufficient to mention the works of Bruce and Macpherson. The present work deals with the subject from a different standpoint. I have traced the history of the East India Trade in the seventeenth century, and estimated its influence on the foreign, no less than the economic, policy of England during the period. The question, How far and to what extent was the English economic and foreign policy affected by the East India Trade? could be answered only after a thorough and careful study of the data for the period. I tried to utilize the essential data preserved in the British Museum Library, the Bodleian Library, the India Office Library and Record Department, and the Public Record Office. Those who take an interest in the bibliography of the subject are referred to my articles in the Journal of Indian History founded and edited by me, and published by the Department of Modern Indian History, Allahabad University. I hope to be able to reprint them next year. About the Publisher Forgotten Books publishes hundreds of thousands of rare and classic books.

This major new textbook brings the science and practice of vegetable production right up to date by addressing modern culture techniques and the recent challenges of consumer demand facing producers today. It introduces vegetable production from the perspective of producing high quality produce that satisfies the needs of the modern consumer. Beginning with the basics of how vegetables are grown using high and low input methods, including organic and sustainable production techniques, the book goes on to introduce and discuss many topics covered less comprehensively in older texts, including Good Agricultural Practices to improve quality, reduce biological contamination and secure food safety; water management; cropping systems; plasticulture; protected culture and mineral nutrition. Vegetable Production and Practices also introduces the use of molecular biology for genetic improvement of crops.

It is intended to give a preliminary grammatical overview of epigraphic Lanna Thai in Fak Kham script and is part of a series consisting of an epigraphic glossary and a catalog of inscriptions, published as AKM 73,1 and AKM 73,2, respectively. The grammar serves as an aid to better understand the vocabulary in its inscriptional context. It consists of three main parts: phonology and orthography, syntax, and lexicon. The appendix offers detailed lists of grammatical terms and additional tables, which are a very useful aid for the reading of time and date in inscriptions. The vocabulary of the northern Thai stone inscriptions corpus is confined to one group of texts only and covers a well-defined, limited historical time range. Nevertheless, the grammar may also serve as an aid for the interpretation of other contemporaneous Thai texts of other regions. Even though this book can be used independently, it may still require consulting the Catalogue (AKM 73,2) for complete references to all available texts, images, rubbings or the location of cited inscriptions as original source.

This could hardly have been possible without intense exchange with the rest of Europe. This three-volume series about early modern Hungary divided by Ottoman presence approaches themes of exchange of information and knowledge from two perspectives, namely, exchange through traditional channels provided by religious/educational institutions and the system of European study tours (Volume 1 – Study Tours and Intellectual-Religious Relationships), and the less regular channels and improvised networks of political diplomacy (Volume 2 – Diplomacy, Information Flow and Cultural Exchange). A by-product of this exchange of information was the changing image of early modern Hungary and Transylvania, which is presented in the third and in some aspects concluding volume of essays (Volume 3 – The Making and Uses of the Image of Hungary and Transylvania). Unlike earlier approaches to the same questions, these volumes draw an alternative map of early modern Hungary. On this map, the centre-periphery conceptions of European early modern culture are replaced by new narratives written from the perspective of historical actors, and the dominance of Western-Hungarian relationships is kept in balance due to the significance of Hungary’s direct neighbours, most importantly the Ottoman Empire.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9781443872942', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=7u-mBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=7u-mBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '1443872946', 'pageCount': 295, 'authors': ['Gábor Almási'], 'id': '7u-mBgAAQBAJ'}, {'categories': ['Social Science'], 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=kQbeBgAAQBAJ&dq=17th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'publisher': 'Anchor Academic Publishing (aap_verlag)', 'title': 'Do Organizational Stress Really Matters in Career Satisfaction?', 'description': 'Organizational Role Stress is connected with a multitude of negative effects, where stress and coping with stress are phenomena closely tangled with human life such that the effects of stress are directly related to coping.

Examining the theatres and theatrical profession of the time, he also considers how Shakespeare experienced this world, both as an actor and as a writer. Examining Shakespeare's narrative poems, sonnets, and all of his plays, Wells outlines their sources, style, and originality over the course of Shakespeare's career, to consider the fundamental impact his work has had for subsequent generations. Written with enthusiasm and flair by a scholar who has devoted a lifetime to the study of Shakespeare and his works, this is an engaging and authoritative introduction.

It describes foundational community health concepts and procedures and presents proven strategies for engaging communities as resources for their own health improvementñan important determinant of individual well-being. It is based on recommendations by the World Health Organization's International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health and on the premise that healthy communities are those with populations that participate in their own health promotion, maintenance, and sustenance. The book is unique in its integration of environmental and social justice issues as they significantly affect the advancement of community health. The text focuses on community-oriented health interventions informed by prevention, inclusiveness, and timeliness that both promote better health and are more cost effective than individually focused interventions. It addresses the foundations of community-oriented health services including their history, social determinants, concepts, and policies as well as the economics of community-oriented health services and health disparities and equity. It covers procedures for designing, implementing, monitoring, and evaluating sustainable community health coalitions along with tools for measuring their success. Detailed case studies describe specific settings and themes in U.S. and international community health practice in which communities are both enactors and beneficiaries. An accompanying instructor's manual provides learning exercises, field-based experiential assignments, and multiple-choice questions. A valuable resource for students and practitioners of education, public policy, and social services, this book bridges the perspectives of environmental justice, public health, and community well-being and development, which, while being mutually interdependent, have rarely been considered together. KEY FEATURES: Offers a new paradigm for improving public health through community-driven health coalitions Includes evidence-based strategies for engaging communities in the pursuit of health Demonstrates how to design, implement, monitor, and evaluate community health partnerships Presents transdisciplinary approaches that consider environmental and social justice variables Includes contributions of international authors renowned in community health research and practice", 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9780826198181', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8qqgBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8qqgBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '082619818X', 'pageCount': 384, 'authors': ['Elias Mpofu, PhD, DEd, CRC'], 'id': '8qqgBQAAQBAJ'}, {'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'categories': ['Architecture'], 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=rXi8BQAAQBAJ&dq=17th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'ISBN_13': '9781118541197', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=rXi8BQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=rXi8BQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '1118541197', 'pageCount': 200, 'publisher': 'John Wiley & Sons', 'authors': ['Diana Balmori'], 'title': 'Drawing and Reinventing Landscape, AD Primer', 'id': 'rXi8BQAAQBAJ'}, {'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'categories': ['Science'], 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=82izBQAAQBAJ&dq=17th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'ISBN_13': '9781119007784', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=82izBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=82izBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '111900778X', 'publisher': 'John Wiley & Sons', 'authors': ['Patrick Prouzet'], 'title': 'Development of Marine Resources', 'description': 'Marine resources and their exploitation, recovery and economic networks they generate are here from the perspective now inevitable growing environmental constraints, policy management and technical innovation.

From the central highlands of the almost 1500-metre high island, countless, steep-walled gorges wind down to the sea, slicing the otherwise gently sloping island coast like a cake. La Gomera is made for nature-loving walkers, and offers an incredible variety in its countryside: Idyllic valleys with terraced fields and palm groves stand in contrast to precipitous cliffs and spectacular gorges; the magical laurel forests of Garajonay National Park are countered by pine forests and banana plantations. Thus, the hiker can expect a pleasant stroll like no other, between blazing lava beaches, lush, misty primeval forests, ridges shrouded in clouds – and the ever-present, deep-blue Atlantic. This Rother Walking Guide presents the hiker with a wide variety of entertaining tour recommendations encompassing all regions of La Gomera. These walks range from comfortable paths through palm-studded valleys, to tranquil mountain strolls, to panoramic summit climbs – hiking trails through the dreamy, misty primeval forest are mentioned, as well as the partly paved caminos, which once represented the main connecting roads between villages. Many of the 53 tour recommendations are ideal for less experienced hikers. Yet experienced mountain hikers who are not afraid of power hikes and can handle a shot of adventure and risk will also find a rich selection of routes. This excellently researched guide is enhanced by outstanding colour photos and map excerpts based on the Freytag&Berndt hiking map of Gomera (scale 1:35,000), and is highly recommended to all mountain fans of the island.

Crosher dedicates his work to “those engineers and organizations that give freely of their time and experience to develop standards and technical conferences that are so crucial to the progress of the gear industry.” In my experience, Crosher demonstrates this same desire to know all he can about his profession, and to contribute to its continued growth and evolution in an ongoing and proactive manner. As complicated and technical as some of the topics he discusses can be, Crosher writes in a manner that is straightforward, accessible, and informative. In other words, he harnesses the same approach utilized by any good teacher in finding a way to engage his audience while at the same time conveying valuable information. He achieves this by providing historical and peripheral material that brings the subject under discussion to life. In chapters devoted to the fundamentals of gearing, definitions of gear elements, materials, and processes such as heat treating, the author builds a solid foundation for later chapters on subjects including spur, helical, and worm gear design, gear manufacturing and inspection, lubrication properties, and failure modes, along with an analysis of those examined. Topics are explored fully and explained clearly, with a wealth of helpful illustrations in support of the text. References and resources are listed at the end of the book, including contact information for associations that can assist in the reader’s continued professional growth. The former director of the National Conference on Power Transmission, as well as former chairman of the American Gear Manufacturers Association’s Marketing Council and Enclosed Drive Committee, Crosher was resident engineer-North America for Thyssen Gear Works, and later at Flender Graffenstaden. He is author of the book Design and Application of the Worm Gear and longtime writer of the “Tooth Tips” column that appears each month in the pages of Gear Solutions magazine, which is published by Media Solutions, Inc. As editor I can attest to the fact that his work generates a high degree of reader response, and that he is both known and respected in the gear-manufacturing industry around the world. It is an honor to be in a position to share his knowledge and expertise with our readers, and to have the opportunity to comment on his latest professional endeavor.

Like many artists whose style is unique in their own time, he left few direct followers; the closest was Adriaen Brouwer, who used Hals's techniques well to portray tavern scenes and similar subjects. Hals was for a long time regarded as a competent but limited painter whose consistent neglect of any subjects other than portraits gave him no place in the history of significant art. It was not until the 19th century that interest in his work was revived. He influenced Edouard Manet with his free style and Vincent van Gogh with his subtle range of colors.

Comparable to modern satellite surveying (GPS), true to scale landscape representation is also indebted to the interdisciplinary exchange of knowledge: the alliance of geodesists, mathematicians, instrument makers and painters. Artists had designed modern surveying systems long before new media drew on images from outer space. The exhibition "Mapping Spaces" examines, for the first time ever on this scale, the influence of early modern guide books in geography, the science of surveying and the construction of fortification on Dutch painting around 1650. The prelude to the project, developed at the University of Trier, is Pieter Snayers\' large-format depiction of historical battle scenes, in which maps and landscape paintings are projected over one another so as to document the most recent developments in modern engineering, ballistics and the fortification construction. Over 220 exhibits, among them paintings, surveying instruments, graphics devices, books, maps and globes drawn from the most important collections of works, such as from the Prado (Madrid), the Louvre (Paris), the Rijksmuseum (Amsterdam) or the Kunsthistorischen Museum (Vienna) testify to these new theses in pictorial science. The new mapping of an early modern area of knowledge is accompanied by contemporary works of art that thematize the influence of technological developments on our present-day perception of space.--Museum website.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9783777422305', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=j3YtngEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=j3YtngEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '3777422304', 'pageCount': 500, 'authors': ['Ulrike Gehring'], 'id': 'j3YtngEACAAJ'}, {'categories': ['Political Science'], 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=8k-LBAAAQBAJ&dq=17th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'publisher': 'ABC-CLIO', 'title': 'Buying of the Presidency?, The: Franklin D.

Yet the election remains largely unstudied despite the fact that critical decisions by some of the most colorful—and controversial—characters in American history make it one of the most significant ever to take place. This landmark work, the first specifically about the 1936 election, highlights the key debates, events, and personalities that epitomized the conflicted, highly charged politics of the New Deal era. In telling its gripping tale, the book discloses the secret history of Roosevelt's New Deal. It uncovers the hidden roles that money, patronage, and power played in the campaign of 1936, underscoring the transition from the old-school politics of stump-speaking and glad-handing to a new world of professionalism marked by scientific polling, targeted advertising, and direct media. The book offers a new perspective on this critical period in American history through its use of previously unpublished private correspondence and internal memos from key players in the Roosevelt administration as well as from GOP chairman John Hamilton. These archival sources detail the nuts and bolts of running a presidential campaign during the Great Depression and reveal how money was manipulated to buy votes.

John Gottman delves into the unquantifiable realm of love, armed with science and logic, and emerges with the knowledge that relationships can be not only understood, but also predicted as well. Based on research done at his Love Lab and other laboratories, Gottman has discovered that the future of love relationships can be predicted with a startling 91% success rate. These predictions can help couples to prevent disasters in their relationships, recognize the signs of a promising relationship, and perhaps more importantly, recognize the signs of a doomed one. Principia Amoris also introduces Love Equations, a mathematical modeling of relationships that helps understand predictions. Love Equations are powerful tools that can prevent relationship distress and heal ailing relationships. Readers learn about the various research and studies that were done to discover the science behind love, and are treated to a history of the people, ideas, and events that shaped our current understanding. They also learn about: • The “Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse” • 45 natural principles of love • 5 couple types • 5 recipes for good relationships • And much more!

This unique book asks a simple question: how can Britain organise itself, not just for survival but to build a fairer and sustainable society? The arguments refer to the high ambitions of those who pioneered the planning movement and campaigned for a clear set of progressive values, but whose drive for utopia has now been forgotten. The book takes a distinctive approach to exploring the value to society of social town planning and offers a doorway for how planning, both morally and practically, can help to meet key challenges of the 21st century. It challenges the widely held view that itÕs impossible to achieve a better future by suggesting that there is real choice in how society develops and pointing to contemporary examples of utopia.

All were proposed in the seventeenth century by Théophraste Renaudot, who felt they were necessary to meet the new social realities of the time. With the support of Cardinal Richelieu he was able to attack the problem of poverty in a new way by setting up the Bureau d'Adresse, which grew from an employment agency to a clearing- house for many social services, including free medical care. The discussions that were held there made it the most popular academy in Europe and the forerunner of the Académie Françise. At the same time Renaudot was editing and publishing the Gazette, an important instrument of government propaganda. Howard M. Solomon considers each aspect of Renaudot's multi-dimensional career and examines the relationship between his activities and the needs and methods of the ministries of Richelieu and Mazarin. While they had Richelieu's support all his novel schemes flourished, but only the Gazette survived the Cardinal's death. Originally published in 1972.

What factors govern each reading? DeLapp here attempts to set up a test case for observing how both socio-historical and textual factors play a part in how a person reads a biblical text. Using a reception-historical methodology, he surveys five Reformed authors and their readings of the David and Saul story (primarily 1 Sam 24 and 26). From this survey two interrelated phenomena emerge. First, all the authors find in David an ideal model for civic praxis a Davidic social imaginary (Charles Taylor). Second, despite this primary agreement, the authors display two different reading trajectories when discussing David s relationship with Saul. Some read the story as showing a persecuted exile, who refuses to offer active resistance against a tyrannical monarch. Others read the story as exemplifying active defensive resistance against a tyrant. To account for this convergence and divergence in the readings, DeLapp argues for a two-fold conclusion. The authors are influenced both by their socio-historical contexts and by the shape of the biblical text itself. Given a Deuteronomic frame conducive to the social imaginary, the paradigmatic narratives of 1 Sam 24 and 26 offer a narrative gap never resolved. The story never makes explicit to the reader what David is doing in the wilderness in relation to King Saul. As a result, the authors fill in the gap in ways that accord with their own socio-historical experiences.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9780567655493', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=eqPvAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=eqPvAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '0567655490', 'pageCount': 224, 'authors': ['Nevada Levi DeLapp'], 'id': 'eqPvAwAAQBAJ'}, {'categories': ['Language Arts & Disciplines'], 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=wKnnBQAAQBAJ&dq=17th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'publisher': 'Walter de Gruyter GmbH & Co KG', 'title': 'Manual of Language Acquisition', 'description': 'This manual contains overviews on language acquisition and distinguishes between first- and second-language acquisition.

Readers will discover a non-linear approach to legal history as this work investigates the ways in which law is created. These chapters look at factors in legal revolution such as the role of agents, the policy of applying and publicising legal norms, codification and the orientations of legal writing, and there is a focus on the publicization of law. The author uses Herbert Hart’s schemes to conceive law as a human artefact or convention, being the union between primary rules of obligations and secondary rules conferring powers. Here we learn about those secondary rules and the legal construction of the Modern state and we question the extent to which codification and law reporting were likely to revolutionize the legal field. These chapters examine the hypothesis of a legal revolution that could have concerned many countries in modern times. To begin with, the book considers the legal aspect of the construction of Modern States in the 17th and 18th centuries. It goes on to examine the consequences of the codification movement as a legal revolution before looking at the so-called “constitutional” revolution, linked with the extension of judicial review in many countries after World War II. Finally, the book enquires into the construction of an EU legal order and international law. In each of these chapters, the author measures the scope of the change, how the secondary rules are concerned, the role of the professional lawyers and what are the characters of the new configuration of the legal field. This book provokes new debates in legal philosophy about the rule of change and will be of particular interest to researchers in the fields of law, theories of law, legal history, philosophy of law and historians more broadly.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9783319058887', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ocopBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ocopBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '3319058886', 'pageCount': 194, 'authors': ['Jean-Louis Halpérin'], 'id': 'ocopBAAAQBAJ'}, {'categories': ['Social Science'], 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=U8WiBQAAQBAJ&dq=17th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'publisher': 'DEStech Publications, Inc', 'subtitle': '', 'title': 'International Conference on Humanity and Social Science, (ICHSS2014)', 'description': 'The conference will be held in Guangzhou, China during June 29-30, 2014.

Initially many of the leading scientists were churchmen indicating a symbiosis between faith and reason. Due to the increasing specialization in the sciences this close connection came to an end often leading to antagonism and mutual suspicion. This book traces this historical development with its twists and turns in both Europe and North America. It depicts the major players in this story and outlines their specific contributions. The main focus is on the 19th and 20th centuries with figures such as Darwin and Hodge, but also Beecher and Abbott in the 19th century. In the 20th century the narrative starts with Karl Barth and moves all the way to Hawking and Tipler. Special attention is given to representatives from North America, Great Britain, and Germany. In conclusion important issues are presented in the present-day dialogue between theology and the natural sciences. The issue of design and fine-tuning is picked up, and advances in brain research. Finally technological issues are assessed and the status of medicine as a helpmate for life is discussed.

The old Etruscan city of Grifonia swarms with year-abroad students—thousands of them from all over. Ostensibly, they\'ve come to study. But really they are here to reinvent themselves, to shuck their identities and buck constraints far from the watchful eyes of parents and others who know them too well. There\'s a reason Henry James\'s young ladies went to Europe with chaperones. Today\'s young ladies don\'t. In Abroad, the bestselling novelist Katie Crouch—whose Girls in Trucks brilliantly portrayed the cruelties of postcollege New York life on a Southern girl trying to make her way—tears a story from international headlines and transforms it into a page-turning parable of modern girlhood, full of longing and reckless behavior. As the heroine (and the reader) of Abroad will soon discover, Grifonia is a city filled with dangerous secrets of many kinds: ancient, eternal, infernal. "Prepare to have your heart broken while laughing out loud at this breathtaking, scathingly sardonic novel," wrote People magazine\'s reviewer about Crouch\'s Men and Dogs. "From her opening line. . . Crouch grabs you and never lets go."

Recent growth in student numbers and the demand for new and more diverse Arabic language programs of instruction have created a need that has outpaced the ability of teacher preparation programs to provide sufficient numbers of well-qualified professional teachers at the level of skill required. Arabic language program administrators anticipate that the increases in enrollment will continue into the next decades. More resources and more varied materials are seriously needed in Arabic teacher education and training. The goal of this Handbook is to address that need. The most significant feature of this volume is its pioneer role in approaching the field of Arabic language teaching from many different perspectives. It offers readers the opportunity to consider the role, status, and content of Arabic language teaching in the world today. The Handbook is intended as a resource to be used in building Arabic language and teacher education programs and in guiding future academic research. Thirty-four chapters authored by leaders in the field are organized around nine themes: *Background of Arabic Language Teaching; *Contexts of Arabic Language Teaching; *Communicative Competence in Arabic; *The Learners; *Assessment; *Technology Applications; *Curriculum Development, Design, and Models; *Arabic Language Program Administration and Management; and *Planning for the Future of Arabic Language Learning and Teaching. The Handbook for Arabic Language Teaching Professionals in the 21st Century will benefit and be welcomed by Arabic language teacher educators and trainers, administrators, graduate students, and scholars around the world. It is intended to create dialogue among scholars and professionals in the field and in related fields--dialogue that will contribute to creating new models for curriculum and course design, materials and assessment tools, and ultimately, better instructional effectiveness for all Arabic learners everywhere, in both Arabic-speaking and non-Arabic speaking countries.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9781136781629', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=jZW3AwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=jZW3AwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '1136781625', 'pageCount': 512, 'authors': ['Kassem Wahba', 'Zeinab A.

First, it examines the field within the rich intellectual and cultural context of everyday life, cross-cultural influences, and contributions from literature, art, and other disciplines. Second, it is a history of ideas, concepts, and questions, instead of dates, events, or great minds. Third, the book explores the history of applied, developmental, clinical, and cognitive psychology as well as experimental psychology. Conveyed in a lively writing style, this text tells a gripping story that continues to the present day. Its current perspective allows students to connect the history of the field to the work being published in current journals. O’Boyle writes in the “historical present”, giving readers a sense of immediacy and aliveness as they journey through history. Her account uses imaginative new features, including “The Times”, which gives readers a feel for what everyday life was like during the age discussed in the chapter. Descriptions of ordinary life, as well as information about important issues influencing their lives such as wars, social movements, famines, and plagues, pique students\' interest. "Stop and Think" questions, scattered throughout, enhance retention and encourage critical thinking. An ideal text for a history of psychology or history and systems of psychology course, this creative new book will also appeal to those with a general interest in the field.

Un pequeño grupo de jóvenes investigadores de menos de treinta años convence a un grupo mucho más numeroso de la misma edad para celebrar en Salamanca la First Conference of Young Researchers on Anglophone Studies. El resultado es deslumbrante. No solo demuestran una gran capacidad organizativa, sino que los resultados individuales de las aportaciones científicas son sobresalientes. Este volumen, Current Trends in Anglophone Studies, recoge una selección revisada de las propuestas presentadas en el Encuentro y gira en torno a una estructuración tripartita clásica: estudios culturales, lingüísticos y literarios. En ella caben todos aquellos que se mueven en el campo de los estudios anglófonos. Cada uno de estos campos podría haber sido suficiente para celebrar un congreso, pero parece razonable que en este tipo de encuentros tengan cabida todos. De ese modo, este volumen se convierte en un ejemplo de aproximación interdisciplinar a los estudios anglófonos. Desde un punto de vista cuantitativo, los estudios culturales ocupan sin duda un espacio menor. Sin embargo, sobresale la variedad de temas tratados, así como la internacionalización de los autores, dentro de este apartado. Estudiantes españoles e italianos acometen estudios relacionados con la música, la pintura, el cine, la traducción, la marginalidad social o el impacto de las nuevas tecnologías en la producción artística. Si no pareciera demasiado atrevido, podría decirse que estos jóvenes estudiosos irían más allá de lo que un día ya lejano pudieron imaginar Richard Hoggard o Raymond Williams. Los estudios aquí presentados reflejan, sin duda, la evolución que la propia sociedad ha experimentado en estos últimos cincuenta años y exploran la relación entre las prácticas culturales, la vida diaria, y los contextos económicos, políticos e históricos. No es de extrañar que una gran parte de las contribuciones presentadas en este volumen se centren en el estudio de la lengua, ya que la demanda del inglés se ha incrementado de forma considerable en los últimos años. Sobresalen los análisis puramente filológicos y sobre todo los relacionados con el aprendizaje del inglés como segunda lengua. Por eso, destacan estudios que contemplan rasgos morfológicos, léxicos o sintácticos. Sin embargo, el mayor número de participaciones hace referencia al ya citado aprendizaje del inglés como L2, tanto desde el análisis de materiales, como desde la práctica oral o escrita. Las contribuciones literarias ofrecen una evaluación teórica, formal e interpretativa de distintas tendencias desde perspectivas tanto interdisciplinares como interculturales. Cronológicamente los estudios abarcan textos desde el siglo XVIII hasta nuestros días, con un acento especial en los autores más contemporáneos y en el género narrativo. En general estos estudios se fijan en textos concretos y los analizan desde perspectivas culturales, sociológicas o psicológicas. Pero abundan menos las aproximaciones desde la teoría literaria, desde la técnica narrativa o, como tal vez cabría esperar al tratarse de estudiantes tan jóvenes, desde la aplicación de las nuevas tecnologías. Por el contrario, se repiten temas como los traumas heredados de la Guerra de Vietnam, las cicatrices del 11 de septiembre o los problemas de género. En definitiva, se trata de una selección de artículos claramente prometedora, que transmite la seguridad de que el futuro de la Filología Inglesa está en buenas manos y podrá experimentar una positiva evolución en los próximos años. Por todo ello, hay que felicitar a todos los participantes individuales y, sobre todo, a los organizadores del evento, y editores de este volumen, que han demostrado una enorme capacidad de trabajo y de saber hacer.'}, {'categories': ['Philosophy'], 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=Tyx-AwAAQBAJ&dq=17th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'publisher': 'ICRL Press', 'subtitle': 'Healing the Mind', 'title': 'THE SPIRIT OF SPINOZA', 'description': 'BENEDICT SPINOZA was a 17th-century philosopher and spiritual psychotherapist. This intellectual self-help book provides important insights from Spinoza’s system of thought in a format accessible to the general reader, as well as to those already familiar with his philosophy. By applying his method to our personal lives, we may free ourselves from bondage to our lower emotions and habitual behaviors and thus begin to enjoy the “continuous, supreme, and unending happiness” promised by Spinoza. “Those of us who came of age in the twentieth century were taught that we must adopt a crazy-making strategy of compartmentalizing our lives, putting our rational, scientific side into one corner and our psychological/spiritual side in another. The precarious state of our world is evidence enough that this approach to life is a destructive dead end. You are holding an effective alternative in your hand. The Spirit of Spinoza is a brilliant treatise that has been field-tested by Professor Neal Grossman in his own life and that of his students over decades. This book is a master stroke by a master teacher about a master philosopher. It is also delightfully dangerous, for it has the power to shift one’s life onto a new axis, where it becomes possible to blend knowledge and wisdom into an experience that can best be described, quite simply, as waking up.” —Larry Dossey, MD, author of One Mind: How Our Individual Mind Is Part of a Greater Consciousness and Why It Matters', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9781936033089', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Tyx-AwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Tyx-AwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '1936033089', 'pageCount': 276, 'authors': ['Neal Grossman'], 'id': 'Tyx-AwAAQBAJ'}, {'categories': ['Drama'], 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=mmd9AwAAQBAJ&dq=17th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'publisher': 'Routledge', 'subtitle': 'An Anthology of Plays from the 17th Century to the Present', 'title': 'Adaptations of Shakespeare', 'description': "Shakespeare's plays have been adapted or rewritten in various, often surprising, ways since the seventeenth century.

The goals of the class and the book are to come to recognize English from various time periods, to be able to read each stage with a glossary, to get an understanding of typical language change, internal and external, and to understand something about language typology through the emphasis on the change from synthetic to analytic.

The author examines in detail their mutual doctrinal delineation as well as the conceptualist tenet of the Jesuit Pedro Hurtado de Mendoza (1578–1641), whose thought constitutes an important systematic point of comparison especially with Suárez’s doctrine. The book offers the first comparative elaboration of the issue of universals, in both its metaphysical and its epistemological aspects, in the era of second scholasticism.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9789027270672', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=xWLzAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=xWLzAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '9027270678', 'pageCount': 344, 'authors': ['Daniel Heider'], 'id': 'xWLzAgAAQBAJ'}, {'categories': ['Social Science'], 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=EdYVAwAAQBAJ&dq=17th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'publisher': 'John Wiley & Sons', 'subtitle': 'Revisiting the Second Epidemiological Transition', 'title': 'Modern Environments and Human Health', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9781118504291', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=EdYVAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=EdYVAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '1118504291', 'pageCount': 416, 'authors': ['Molly K.

Examining the lives of farmers and their families, he tells the story of immigration to the colonies, traces patterns of settlement, analyzes the growth of markets, and assesses the impact of the Revolution on small farm society. Beginning with the dispossession of the peasantry in early modern England, Kulikoff follows the immigrants across the Atlantic to explore how they reacted to a hostile new environment and its Indian inhabitants. He discusses how colonists secured land, built farms, and bequeathed those farms to their children. Emphasizing commodity markets in early America, Kulikoff shows that without British demand for the colonists' crops, settlement could not have begun at all. Most important, he explores the destruction caused during the American Revolution, showing how the war thrust farmers into subsistence production and how they only gradually regained their prewar prosperity.", 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9780807860786', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=zK8TBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=zK8TBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '0807860786', 'pageCount': 504, 'authors': ['Allan Kulikoff'], 'id': 'zK8TBAAAQBAJ'}, {'categories': ['Technology & Engineering'], 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=VJOlAgAAQBAJ&dq=17th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'publisher': 'CRC Press', 'title': 'Challenging Glass 4 & COST Action TU0905 Final Conference', 'description': 'This proceedings volume of the Challenging Glass 4 & COST Action TU0905 Final Conference, held 6-7 February 2014 at the EPFL in Lausanne, Switzerland, represents the Final Action Publication of the European research network COST Action TU0905 “Structural Glass – Novel design methods and next generation products”.

Teeming with wildlife, steeped in history, sporting bridges, docks and stunning architecture, not to mention supporting riverside pubs, waterways museums and a variety of places of interest, they are the country's essential arteries, connecting inland Britain with the sea. From such world-renowned rivers as the Trent and Severn to little known tributaries like the Wharf, Wissey and Lark, British River Navigations celebrates England's inland rivers which have been improved for navigation, initially for commercial use, but now mostly carrying leisure craft. A fantastic celebration in its own right, alongside the author's previous Canals of Britain and Rivers of Britain this new book completes a trilogy on the different routes that can be used by large and small craft through the inland as well as tidal rivers of Britain. As with his other two books, it takes a wide ranging and detailed look at the built and natural environments surrounding these waterway gems. It explores the history, folklore, wildlife, literature and nearby towns and villages, all illustrated with beautiful maps and colour photographs. So much more than just a guidebook, it contains fascinating detail about our often surprising waterways right across the country. For anyone enjoying England's rivers for recreation or transportation, this captivating guide gives a fascinating insight into the lifeblood of our countryside.", 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9781472900845', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=9WwDAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=9WwDAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '1472900847', 'pageCount': 256, 'authors': ['Stuart Fisher'], 'id': '9WwDAAAAQBAJ'}, {'categories': ['Travel'], 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=ie8CGcizGwEC&dq=17th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'publisher': 'Time Out Guides', 'title': 'Time Out Madrid', 'description': 'Madrid has gone from shanty town to imperial capital in the last seven centuries. The local writers of Time Out Madrid assist travelers in seeing the city as a native, suggesting where to stay, eat, shop and experience its cultural offerings. Famed for its wild nights and lazy days, Madrid provides a whole lot more, from spectacular opera productions, chirpy folkloric zarzuela, and cutting-edge cuisine to ancient, tiled tabernas, designer-shoe shopping, and numerous flea markets. Written by resident journalists, Time Out Madrid also covers the artistic jewels housed in the Prado, Thyssen, and Reina Sofia, as well as the etiquette of watching a bullfight or joining in with a flamenco performance, as well as where to stay and how to escape the city heat. Also included are the intriguing stories behind some of the city’s best-known paintings, where to find gourmet tapas, the yoga centers, spas, and Turkish baths.

And though the city is reassuringly compact, this does not stop the cultural onslaught from being utterly bewildering and exhausting. While some travelers may have to face the fact that they probably won't see everything, it is also important not to shut oneself up inside all day looking at collections and sites or you will miss all that the outdoor scene has to offer.

Its fame as the first public company which heralded the transition from feudalism to modern capitalism and its remarkable financial success for nearly two centuries ensure its importance in the history of capitalism. Although a publicly owned, highly complex and diversified business, and commonly agreed to be the largest and most profitable business in the 17th century, throughout its existence the Dutch East-India Company never produced public accounts of its financial affairs which would have allowed investors to judge the performance of the Company. Its financial accounting, which changed little during its lifetime, was not designed as an aid to rational investment decision-making by communicating the Company’s financial performance but to be a means of promoting sound stewardship by senior management. This study examines the contributions of accounting to the remarkable success of the Dutch East-India Company and the influences on these accounting practices. From the time that the German economic historian Werner Sombart proposed that accounting techniques, most especially double-entry bookkeeping, were critical to the development of modern capitalism and the public company, historians and accounting scholars have debated the extent and importance of these contributions. The Dutch East-India Company was a capitalistic enterprise that had a public, permanent capital and its principal objective was to continually increase profit by reinvesting its returns in the business. Rather than the organisation and management of the Dutch East-India Company reflecting the perceived benefits of a particular bookkeeping method, the supremacy that it achieved and maintained in a very hazardous business at a time of recurring conflict between European states was a consequence of the practicalities of 17th century business and The Netherlands’ unique, threatening natural environment which shaped its social and political institutions.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9781134747481', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=zQIVAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=zQIVAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '1134747489', 'pageCount': 224, 'authors': ['Warwick Funnell', 'Jeffrey Robertson'], 'id': 'zQIVAgAAQBAJ'}, {'categories': ['Biography & Autobiography'], 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=e9B3BgAAQBAJ&dq=17th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'averageRating': 5.0, 'publisher': 'NUS Press', 'subtitle': 'Security, Trade and Society in 16th- and 17th-century Southeast Asia', 'title': 'The Memoirs and Memorials of Jacques de Coutre', 'description': 'Jacques de Coutre was a Flemish gem trader who spent nearly a decade in Southeast Asia at the turn of the 17th century.

This book details the antecedents of today's flourishing, influential vocation of public relations whose practitioners -- some 150,000 professionals -- make their case for their clients or their employers in the highly competitive public opinion marketplace.", 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9781136688522', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=KT78AQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=KT78AQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '1136688528', 'pageCount': 320, 'authors': ['Scott M.

Historically, axiomatic geometry marks the origin of formalized mathematical activity. It is in this discipline that most historically famous problems can be found, the solutions of which have led to various presently very active domains of research, especially in algebra. The recognition of the coherence of two-by-two contradictory axiomatic systems for geometry (like one single parallel, no parallel at all, several parallels) has led to the emergence of mathematical theories based on an arbitrary system of axioms, an essential feature of contemporary mathematics. This is a fascinating book for all those who teach or study axiomatic geometry, and who are interested in the history of geometry or who want to see a complete proof of one of the famous problems encountered, but not solved, during their studies: circle squaring, duplication of the cube, trisection of the angle, construction of regular polygons, construction of models of non-Euclidean geometries, etc. It also provides hundreds of figures that support intuition. Through 35 centuries of the history of geometry, discover the birth and follow the evolution of those innovative ideas that allowed humankind to develop so many aspects of contemporary mathematics. Understand the various levels of rigor which successively established themselves through the centuries. Be amazed, as mathematicians of the 19th century were, when observing that both an axiom and its contradiction can be chosen as a valid basis for developing a mathematical theory.

Through the stories of the conversions of the Christian villagers, as recorded in contemporary Christian and Muslim sources alike, the book analyzes the factors that shaped conversion in Palestinian villages. At the same time it addresses general issues such as the relationship between individual and mass conversion, and the relationship between these geographical factors and social processes.

It is suggestive to observe, as we scan the unique artistic itinerary offered by the curators of the exhibition, how through the succession of historical periods and particularly by virtue of the esthetic verve and inner sensitivity of the artists, the description of the human person was oriented, with extreme plastic ductility and acuity in their perception of their subjects' physiognomy, to represent not only the body lines of the subject being depicted but, in particular, the most intimate traits of the heart, the lively mobility of their thought, the innermost lines of the subject's character, in an intense dialogue of chiaroscuro observations from which the characterizing notes of complex personages are evinced – persons who appear completely clear and evident only to those who are capable of sublimating their outward appearance into an acute observation. From this prestigious gallery of portraits it emerges unmistakably how the anthropocentric path of human thought has manifestly reverberated within the bounds of the figurative arts through a progressive contextualization, which sees the subject represented unbound through a metatemporal aura of rarefied abstraction and placed, naturalistically, in a precise and well defined spatiotemporal sphere. At the same time, we witness a gradual definition of the personage portrayed as the bearer of a clear personal connotation – the self and the identity, which seem to be invisible and thus impossible to represent – no longer, hortatively, as an idealized and metaphoric emblem of absolute values in deference to a markedly ethical and pedagogical conception. The exhibited works, which rightfully range themselves among the most outstanding expressions of portraiture, reveal a deep spiritual harmony evocative of beauty and unleash a lively dialogue with the onlooker based on a real and inherent economy of the act of viewing, albeit freed from the exercise of a psychologism oriented toward uncontrollable wanderings. The reception of the meaning of the formal systems – thoughtful poses and attitudes – involves, to be sure, the active presence of the spectator in a sort of visual dialogue with the portrait that is not considered exclusively as a fixed commemorative system but rather as an interactive structure. In the perspective of the reception, the observer becomes a fundamental element for the construction of the meaning of the image that, from this very private perspective, undergoes obvious momentous transformations. Observer and image thus become integral parts of a fascinating system of visual exchange not unlike the mechanisms of verbal dialogue: both members of the “pair” take on contemporaneously the dual role of subject/object, restructuring the complex relational web established in a rapport between an “I” and a “you.” Beyond the temporal contingencies, each portrait is recounted and seduces us through the universal language of fame: this incarnates, deeply, the artist's attempt to describe the personality of the subjects portrayed, consigning the multiform essence of their nature to one attitude or to a single expression by resorting to a refined psychological introspection in an attempt to render visually the subject's inner world. It is owing to the above considerations that, while I applaud the felicitous initiative of giving life to such a culturally transcendent exhibition, I would wish that all those who will have the pleasure of visiting it or at least of perusing the pages of this catalogue will be able to perceive the portraits of the individual popes not as so many freestanding elements, but rather as integrated parts of a related set of men who, albeit struggling with the many and varied anxieties of everyday life, endeavored to serve Christ among their brothers, each one with a clear perception of himself as servo servorum Dei – the servant of God's servants! Through looks, attitudes and symbols committed by the artist in a well-constructed iconographic code to the pictorial or sculptural page, the discerning observer cannot help but grasp a veiled spiritual harmony that reflects the profound mystery of faith and propagates an echo of the ineffable beauty of God, revealing how, through art, man – pulled between the eternal and the transient – strives to draw close to his Creator.

For eight centuries mathematics has been researched and studied at Oxford, and the subject and its teaching have undergone profound changes during that time. This highly readable and beautifully illustrated book reveals the richness and influence of Oxford's mathematical tradition and the fascinating characters that helped to shape it. The story begins with the founding of the University of Oxford and the establishing of the medieval curriculum, in which mathematics had an important role. The Black Death, the advent of printing, the Civil War, and the Newtonian revolution all had a great influence on the development of mathematics at Oxford. So too did many well-known figures: Roger Bacon, Henry Savile, Robert Hooke, Christopher Wren, Edmond Halley, Florence Nightingale, Charles Dodgson (Lewis Carroll), and G. H. Hardy, to name but a few. Later chapters bring us to the 20th century, with some entertaining reminiscences by Sir Michael Atiyah of the thirty years he spent as an Oxford mathematician. In this second edition the story is brought right up to the opening of the new Mathematical Institute in 2013 with a foreword from Marcus du Sautoy and recent developments from Peter M.

But his study is more than just a political history. Goscha brings geography to bear on his subject with a passion. While he considers the little-known political movements of such well-known faces as Phan Boi Chau and Ho Chi Minh across Southeast Asia, the author takes us into the complex Asian networks stretching from northeastern Thailand and the port of Bangkok to southern China and Hong Kong - and beyond.

This is true because English spoken a millennium ago significantly differs from English spoken today. But how did it change and who were the in-novators who promoted language change in the course of time? It is the aim of the following research paper to show how and why the pronominal system changed from thou to you as the standard second person singular pronoun in the course of the Early Modern English period (1500-1700). More precisely, private correspondence from the 17th century will be examined to see why thou or you respectively were chosen and if it was one gender rather than the other who mainly contributed to the standard that we have today. The first chapter is going to shed light on Renaissance England and its demographical facts with particular emphasis on the role of women. General information will be included as well as some facts about family life, and most importantly, about education and literacy, which is imperative for language change found in written texts. The second chapter is going to investigate when, how and why a change in the pronominal system from thou to you occurred. In order to do so the concepts of power and solidarity as well as aspects of politeness theory will be considered. Chapter two is going to finish with a summary of assumptions about gender differences in pronoun usage. In chapter three a small-scale qualitative analysis of letters by female and male writers to family members will be carried out. The material is taken from the Corpus of Early English Correspondence (CEEC) as well as from the Helsinki Corpus (HC).

This is the period of such classic novels as Tom Jones, Candide, and Dangerous Liaisons, but beyond the dozen or so recognized classics there are hundreds of other interesting novels that appeared then, known only to specialists: Spanish picaresques, French heroic romances, massive Chinese novels, Japanese graphic novels, eccentric English novels, and the earliest American novels. These minor novels are not only interesting in their own right, but also provide the context needed to appreciate why the major novels were major breakthroughs. The novel experienced an explosive growth spurt during these centuries as novelists experimented with different forms and genres: epistolary novels, romances, Gothic thrillers, novels in verse, parodies, science fiction, episodic road trips, and family sagas, along with quirky, unclassifiable experiments in fiction that resemble contemporary, avant-garde works. As in his previous volume, Moore privileges the innovators and outriders, those who kept the novel novel. In the most comprehensive history of this period ever written, Moore examines over 400 novels from around the world in a lively style that is as entertaining as it is informative. Though written for a general audience, The Novel, An Alternative History also provides the scholarly apparatus required by the serious student of the period.

While hefty bodies were once a sign of power, today those who struggle to lose weight are considered poor in character and weak in mind. Vigarello traces the eventual equation of fatness with infirmity and the way we have come to define ourselves and others in terms of body type. Vigarello begins with the medieval artists and intellectuals who treated heavy bodies as symbols of force and prosperity. He then follows the shift during the Renaissance and early modern period to courtly, medical, and religious codes that increasingly favored moderation and discouraged excess. Scientific advances in the eighteenth century also brought greater knowledge of food and the body’s processes, recasting fatness as the “relaxed” antithesis of health. The body-as-mechanism metaphor intensified in the early-nineteenth century, with the chemistry revolution and heightened attention to food-as-fuel, which turned the body into a kind of furnace or engine. During this period, social attitudes toward fat became conflicted, with the bourgeois male belly operating as a sign of prestige but also as a symbol of greed and exploitation, while the overweight female was admired only if she was working class. Vigarello concludes with the fitness and body conscious movements of the twentieth century and the proliferation of personal confessions about obesity, which cemented the social implications of personal behavior and tied fat more closely to notions of personality, politics, taste, and class.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9780231535304', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=yTogAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=yTogAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '0231535309', 'pageCount': 297, 'authors': ['Georges Vigarello', 'C.

Black Americans make up the single largest minority in the United States, the second-largest group after whites in the United States.

On the other hand, it has enjoyed periods in the past when more operas were produced to greater acclaim. Those periods inevitably have pride of place in this Historical Dictionary of Opera, as do exceptional singers, and others who combine to fashion the opera, whether or not they appear on stage. But this volume looks even further afield, considering the cities which were and still are opera centers, literary works which were turned into librettos, and types of pieces and genres. While some of the former can be found on the web or in other sources, most of the latter cannot and it is impossible to have the whole picture without them. Indeed, this book has an amazingly broad scope. The dictionary section, with about 340 entries, covers the topics mentioned above but obviously focuses most on composers, not just the likes of Mozart, Verdi and Wagner, but others who are scarcely remembered but made notable contributions. Of course, there are the divas, but others singers as well, and some of the most familiar operas, Don Giovanni, Tosca and more. Technical terms also abound, and reference to different genres, from antimasque to zarzuela. Since opera has been around so long, the chronology is rather lengthy, since it has a lot of ground to cover, and the introduction sets the scene for the rest. This book should not be an end but rather a beginning, so it has a substantial bibliography for readers seeking more specific or specialized works. It is an excellent access point for readers interested in opera.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9780810879430', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=FeoQAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=FeoQAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '0810879433', 'pageCount': 562, 'authors': ['Scott L.

EDITOR\'S PREFACE The purpose of this book is to provide a fairly broad survey of the Swedish legal system. In order to avoid possible disappointment, it would seem important to make clear from the outset what kind of questions the authors propose to answer and what groups of readers they are addressing. The easiest way to do this is to set out what we are not purporting to do. Thus, the book is not intended to serve as a primer for students who possess no knowledge of "the law", i. e. of the concepts, ideas and solutions of at least one legal system. Nor is it the purpose of the authors to give practitioners the kind of precise, techni cal answers to isolated questions that they need when advising their clients on the proper course of action in business, or litigation, con ducted within the framework of the legal system described.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9789401743471', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ne_VBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ne_VBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '9401743479', 'pageCount': 256, 'authors': ['Stig Stromholm'], 'id': 'ne_VBQAAQBAJ'}, {'categories': ['Philosophy'], 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=G959BwAAQBAJ&dq=17th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'publisher': 'Springer Science & Business Media', 'subtitle': 'Istoriko-Filosofskaja Nauka', 'title': 'Soviet Historiography of Philosophy', 'description': "`Scientific history of philosophy' was one of the professional branches of Soviet philosophy, and a place where philosophical culture was preserved in an often hostile environment. Situated between the ideological exigencies of the Soviet system with its Marxist-Leninist `theoretical foundation' and the need for an objective account of philosophy's past, Soviet history of philosophy displays the characteristic features of Soviet philosophy as a whole, including a forceful reappearance of its Hegelian background. This book is the only Western monograph on this important part of Soviet philosophy, thus filling the last main gap in Western `Philosophical Sovietology'. At the same time, it offers the first survey of Soviet philosophy after the disappearance of the Soviet system itself, embarking on an historical and meta-philosophical investigation of Soviet philosophical culture. The book will be of interest to students of Soviet and Russian philosophy, historians of philosophy and specialists in Soviet studies.", 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9789401589437', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=G959BwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=G959BwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '9401589437', 'pageCount': 296, 'authors': ['Evert van der Zweerde'], 'id': 'G959BwAAQBAJ'}, {'categories': ['Social Science'], 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=HROkBwAAQBAJ&dq=17th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'publisher': 'Springer Science & Business Media', 'title': 'A Primer of Population Dynamics', 'description': 'A Primer of Population Dynamics introduces to the basics of population studies.

A theologian who was firmly committed to the Lutheran confession, he could yet see very c1early the flaws in his church and argue for their reform; without being an ecumenicist in the modern sense, he yet admired many aspects of the society he observed in Calvinist Geneva, and he recognised the outstanding merit of individual Catholic scholars. A linguist and a lover of art and music, he was the friend of scientists and an enthusiastic student of mathematics whö held that science leads both to an appreciation of the wonders of the material world and its rejection in favour of more spiritual concerns. In his satirical writing he could be ironic and flippant, his rhetoric was often laboured and over elaborate, but there is no mistaking the sincerity of his outrage at cruelty, inhumanity and injustice. Andrere was optimistic, in that he believed that the corruption and deceit, the luxm. y and deprivation, the hypocrisy, tyranny and sophistry of the age could be transformed in a second reformation; yet there runs through his life a deep-rooted pessimism or depression which makes his willingness to continue the struggle all the more admirable. As early as 1618, while still a young deacon at the beginning of his career, he defined the four ages of l human life as terror, error, labor and horror.', 'id': 'shcrBgAAQBAJ'}, {'categories': ['Travel'], 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=Yb8DAAAAQBAJ&dq=17th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'publisher': 'The Countryman Press', 'title': '500+ All-American Family Adventures', 'description': 'A state-by-state guide to the places that offer a unique insight into American culture 500+ All-American Family Adventures is a thoughtful handbook that will help you plan family vacations and day trips that are both entertaining and educational.

It experienced the emergence of a new sort of music, increasingly secular and increasingly good listening, if you will, and also the start of opera. Some of the Baroque composers appear among the most popular of all time, such as Bach, Handel and Vivaldi. So yes, this is a book for researchers, but it is also a good book for anyone who enjoys this music. The Historical Dictionary of Baroque Music certainly fills a significant space in the whole sub-series on music, since it tells us much more not only about the music but also the age that generated it. This is done particularly well in an insightful introduction, with the flow of events traced by the chronology. The dictionary section fills in the missing details with over 400 entries on the most important composers and musicians, some of the musical works themselves, important places and institutions, and a smattering of technical terms.

The series provides a medium for those who study art, those who interpret it, and occasionally those who create it, formally to explore the meaning of an artistic work as the direct reflection of the inner world of its creator. Within each volume, individual topics are addressed by either an art historian or a psychoanalyst, with a response frequently tendered by an expert from the other field. Reviews of important books of cross-disciplinary interest are treated in a similar manner, and include rebuttals by the authors themselves. It is precisely this exchange of ideas among scholars with difference perspectives on the meaning of a work of art that sets PPA apart from the standard art history publication. Its depth of scholarship, coupled with its innovative format, make it a fascinating addition to the burgeoning field of psychoanalytic studies of art history.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9781134877737', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=l2S9Gfze97YC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=l2S9Gfze97YC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '1134877730', 'pageCount': 342, 'authors': ['Mary M.

These forts were of two types: the major stone forts, and other forts made of wood and earth, all of which varied widely in style from Vauban-type elements to cabins surrounded by a stockade. Some forts, such as Chambly, looked more like medieval castles in their earliest incarnations.

Whether or not the earth's magnetic field had anything to do with their navigational abilities has sufaced and been dismissed several times, beginning at least in the mid to late 1800s. This topic generally remained out of the mainstream of scientific research for two reasons: (1) The apparent irreproducibility of many of the be havioral experiments which were supposed to demonstrate the existence of the magnetic sense; and (2) Perceived theoretical difficulties which were encountered when biophysi cists tried to understand how such a sensory system might operate. However, during the mid to late 1960s as the science of ethology (animal behavior) grew, it became clear from studies on bees and birds that the geomagnetic field is used under a variety of conditions. As more and more organisms were found to have similar abilities, the problem shifted back to the question as to the basis of this perception. Of the various schemes for trans ducing the geomagnetic field to the nervous system which have been proposed, the hy pothesis of magnetite-based magnetoreception discussed at length in this volume has per haps the best potential for explaining a wide range of these effects, even though this link is as yet clear only in the case of magnetotactic bacteria.", 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9781461303138', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=A_UxBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=A_UxBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '1461303133', 'pageCount': 704, 'authors': ['Joseph L.

The process is seen as demeaning to artists in the traditional societies, who are seduced into a type of whoredom: unfeeling production of false beauty for money. The arts remain problematic for the social sciences. Sociology textbooks treat the arts as subordinate reflections of social forces, norms, or groups. An thropology textbooks conventionally isolate the arts in a separate chapter, failing to integrate them with analyses of kinship, economics, politics, language, or biology. Textbooks reflect the guiding theories, which emphasize such factors as modes of production, patterns of thought, or biological and normative con straints, but their authors have not adequately formulated the aesthetic dimen sion. One may compare the theoretical status of the arts to that of religion. After the contributions by Emile Durkheim and Max Weber, the sociology of religion is well established, but where is a Durkheim or Weber for the sociology of art?

This book is the fruit of interdisciplinary cooperation among 37 scientists including climatologists, hydrologists, glaciologists, dendroclimatologists, and economic and cultural historians. The known documentary climatic evidence from six European countries is compared to results of tree-ring studies. Seasonal temperature and precipitation are estimated from this data and monthly mean surface pressure patterns in the European area are reconstructed for outstanding anomalies. Results are compared to fluctuations of Alpine glaciers and to changes in the frequency of severe floods and coastal storms. Moreover, the impact of climate change on grain prices and wine production is assessed.

The Colloquium focused on a number of selected themes during a closely defined chronological interval: on the relation of alchemy and chemistry to medicine, philosophy, religion, and to the corpuscular philosophy, in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. The relations between Medicina and alchemy in the Lullian treatises were examined in the opening paper by Michela Pereira, based on researches on unpublished manuscript sources in the period between the 14th and 17th centuries. It is several decades since the researches of R.F. Multhauf gave a prominent role to Johannes de Rupescissa in linking medicine and alchemy through the concept of a quinta essentia.

In some countries, for example the UK, Australia and New Zealand, animal products from grassland make a greater contribution to the value of agricultural production than does any other crop. Yet research being undertaken to further· our understanding of the factors affecting the growth and productivity of grasslands has trailed in the shadow of the determined efforts made to improve our knowledge of cereals and, to a somewhat lesser extent, legumes. However, in spite of its low profile, grassland research has resulted in considerable advances in our knowledge in the last 20 years, and we feel that this book provides a timely opportunity to bring together some of this work in a review of what is primarily the ecophysiology of the temperate grass crop. Unlike other crops grown for their grain or vegatative parts, grass and grassland products are used almost entirely for the feeding of ruminant animals; the interaction of the sward and the animal thus adds an extra dimension to investigations of the productivity of grassland. No one author could adequately encompass the breadth of work covered in the book. Acknowledged experts have therefore been selected as contributors to provide an up-to-date review of their own specialized areas.

The themes that frame the discussions of the complex relationship between the origination of ideas and their reception include the ways in which the ideas of the Scientific Revolution were introduced, the particularities of their expression in each place, the specific forms of resistance encountered by these new ideas, the extent to which such expression and resistance displays national characteristics, the procedures through which new ways of dealing with nature were made legitimate, and the commonalities and differences between the methods developed by scholars for handling scientific issues.", 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9789401147705', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=O3crBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=O3crBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '9401147701', 'pageCount': 224, 'authors': ['Kostas Gavroglu'], 'id': 'O3crBgAAQBAJ'}, {'categories': ['Crafts & Hobbies'], 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=p1nCAgAAQBAJ&dq=17th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'publisher': 'Courier Corporation', 'title': 'Lace and Lace Making', 'description': 'Comprehensive, profusely illustrated book, written with charm and enthusiasm, discusses techniques of making, mending, cleaning, and caring for lace.

Analysis of organizational failures that caused such events helped drive the emerging field of crisis management. Simultaneously, the world has experienced a number of devastating natural disasters: Hurricane Katrina, the Japanese earthquake and tsunami, etc. From such crises, both human-induced and natural, we have learned our modern, tightly interconnected and interdependent society is simply more vulnerable to disruption than in the past. This interconnectedness is made possible in part by crisis management and increases our reliance upon it. As such, crisis management is as beneficial and crucial today as information technology has become over the last few decades. Crisis is varied and unavoidable. While the examples highlighted above were extreme, we see crisis every day within organizations, governments, businesses and the economy. A true crisis differs from a "routine" emergency, such as a water pipe bursting in the kitchen. Per one definition, "it is associated with urgent, high-stakes challenges in which the outcomes can vary widely (and are very negative at one end of the spectrum) and will depend on the actions taken by those involved." Successfully engaging, dealing with, and working through a crisis requires an understanding of options and tools for individual and joint decision making. Our Encyclopedia of Crisis Management comprehensively overviews concepts and techniques for effectively assessing, analyzing, managing, and resolving crises, whether they be organizational, business, community, or political. From general theories and concepts exploring the meaning and causes of crisis to practical strategies and techniques relevant to crises of specific types, crisis management is thoroughly explored. Features & Benefits: A collection of 385 signed entries are organized in A-to-Z fashion in 2 volumes available in both print and electronic formats. Entries conclude with Cross-References and Further Readings to guide students to in-depth resources. Selected entries feature boxed case studies, providing students with "lessons learned" in how various crises were successfully or unsuccessfully managed and why. Although organized A-to-Z, a thematic "Reader\'s Guide" in the front matter groups related entries by broad areas (e.g., Agencies & Organizations, Theories & Techniques, Economic Crises, etc.). Also in the front matter, a Chronology provides students with historical perspective on the development of crisis management as a discrete field of study. The work concludes with a comprehensive Index, which—in the electronic version—combines with the Reader\'s Guide and Cross-References to provide thorough search-and-browse capabilities. A template for an "All-Hazards Preparedness Plan" is provided the backmatter; the electronic version of this allows students to explore customized response plans for crises of various sorts. Appendices also include a Resource Guide to classic books, journals, and internet resources in the field, a Glossary, and a vetted list of crisis management-related degree programs, crisis management conferences, etc.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9781452275963', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=iT11AwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=iT11AwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '1452275963', 'pageCount': 1176, 'authors': ['K.

Can such abstract rules be changed by training? Contrary to the spirit of reductionist theories from behaviorism to connectionism, there is ample evidence that people do make use of abstract rules of inference -- including rules of logic, statistics, causal deduction, and cost-benefit analysis. Such rules, moreover, are easily alterable by instruction as it occurs in classrooms and in brief laboratory training sessions. The fact that purely formal training can alter them and that those taught in one content domain can "escape" to a quite different domain for which they are also highly applicable shows that the rules are highly abstract. The major implication for cognitive science is that people are capable of operating with abstract rules even for concrete, mundane tasks; therefore, any realistic model of human inferential capacity must reflect this fact. The major implication for education is that people can be far more broadly influenced by training than is generally supposed. At high levels of formality and abstraction, relatively brief training can alter the nature of problem-solving for an infinite number of content domains.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9781134775538', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=BtDkblvSb6cC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=BtDkblvSb6cC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '1134775539', 'pageCount': 432, 'authors': ['Richard E.

This book examines that argument, tracing its origin to the glorious memory of Elizabethan maritime war, discussing its supposed economic advantages, and investigating its influence on British politics and naval policy during the War of the Spanish Succession (1702-13) and after. The book reveals that the alleged economic advantages of war at sea were crucial in attracting the support of politicians of different political stances. It shows how supporters of war at sea, both in the government as well as in the opposition, tried to implement pro-maritime war policy by naval operations, colonial expeditions and by legislation, and how their attempts were often frustrated by diplomatic considerations, the incapacity of naval administration, and by conflicting interests between different groups connected to the West Indian colonies and Spanish American trade. It demonstrates how, after the War of the Spanish Succession, arguments for active colonial maritime war continued to be central to political conflict, notably in the opposition propaganda campaigns against the Walpole ministry, culminating in the War of Jenkins's Ear against Spain in 1739. The book also includes material on the South Sea Company, showing how the foundation of this company, later the subject of the notorious 'Bubble', was a logical part of British strategy.

However, Carte sianism as a complete metaphysical system in the image of that of the master collapsed early in the 18th century. A small school of brilliant Cartesians, almost all expert in the new mechanistic science, flashed like meteors upon the intellectual world of late 17th century France to win well-deserved recognition for Cartesianism. They were accompanied by a scintillating comet, Ma1ebranche, the deviant Cartesian, now remembered as the orthodox Cartesians are not. However, all these bright lights faded upon the philosophical horizon, almost as soon as they appeared. The metaphysical dualism of Des cartes was, as such, neither to be preserved nor reconstructed. There are many reasons why the Cartesian system did not survive the victory over Scholasticism which Descartes, Malebranche, and the others had won. Newtonian physics very soon replaced Cartesian physics. The practical interest and success of the new science which the Cartesians themselves had nurtured drew men down from the lofty realms of metaphysics. On the popular front, Cartesianism was attacked and ridiculed for the view that animals are unthinking machines. In the schools of Paris and elsewhere, there was the general but severe opposition of pedants, which is perhaps of more historical than philosophical interest.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9789401029629', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=S_WPBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=S_WPBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '9401029628', 'pageCount': 158, 'authors': ['R.

As I look back on it, our interest and concern with Newton's theological ideas began in 1975 at Washington University in St. Louis. James Force was a graduate student in philosophy and I was a professor there. For a few years before, I had been doing research and writing on Millenarianism and Messianism in the 17th and 18th centuries, touching occasionally on Newton. I had bought a copy of Newton's Observations upon the Prophecies of Daniel, and the Apocalypse of St. John for a few pounds and, occasionally, read in it. In the Spring of 1975 I was giving a graduate seminar on Millenarian and Messianic ideas in the development of modem philosophy. Force was in the seminar. One day he came very excitedly up to me and said he wanted to write his dissertation on William Whiston. At that point in history, the only thing that came to my mind about Whiston was that he had published a, or the, standard translation of Josephus (which I also happened to have in my library. ) Force told me about the amazing views he had found in Whiston's notes on Josephus and in some of the few writings he could find in St. Louis by, or about, Whiston, who was Newton's successor as Lucasian Professor of mathematics at Cambridge and who wrote inordinately on Millenarian theology.", 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9789400919440', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=KOHUBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=KOHUBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '9400919441', 'pageCount': 226, 'authors': ['J.E.

At the same time, responsibilities for technological risk as sessment, evaluation, and management have grown in both the public and private sectors because of a perceived need to anticipate, prevent, or reduce the risks inherent in modem society. In attempting to meet these responsibilities, legislative, judicial, regulatory, and private sector institutions have had to deal with the extraordinarily complex problems of assessing and balancing risks, costs, and benefits. The need to help society cope with technological risks has given rise to a new intellectual endeavor: the social and behavioral study of issues in risk evaluation and risk management. The scope and complexity of these analyses require a high degree of cooperative effort on the part of specialists from many fields. Analyzing social and behavioral issues requires the efforts of political scientists, sociologists, decision analysts, management scientists, econ omists, psychologists, philosophers, and policy analysts, among others.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9781461321033', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=CCmSBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=CCmSBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '1461321034', 'pageCount': 556, 'authors': ['V.T.

The reinterpre tation of the development of science in the seventeenth century, now widely influential, receives at Freudenthal's hand its most persuasive statement, most significantly because of his attention to the theoretical form which is charac teristic. of classical Newtonian mechanics. He pursues the sources of the parallels that may be noted between that mechanics and the dominant philosophical systems and social theories of the time; and in a fascinating development Freudenthal shows how a quite precise method - as he descriptively labels it, the 'analytic-synthetic method' - which underlay the Newtonian form of theoretical argument, was due to certain interpretive premisses concerning particle mechanics. If he is right, these depend upon a particular stage of con ceptual achievement in the theories of both society and nature; further, that the conceptual was generalized philosophically; but, strikingly, Freudenthal shows that this concept-formation itself was linked to the specific social relations of the times of Newton and Hobbes.", 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9789400945005', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ngHZBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ngHZBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '9400945000', 'pageCount': 288, 'authors': ['Gideon Freudenthal'], 'id': 'ngHZBAAAQBAJ'}, {'categories': ['Religion'], 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=145fBgAAQBAJ&dq=17th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'publisher': 'Springer Science & Business Media', 'subtitle': 'One World — Changing Perspectives on Reality', 'title': 'Science and Religion', 'description': "The world is increasingly becoming . one.

The Oirad rose among nomadic and settled states to take control of the Central Asian steppes and play an instrumental role as the modern world was taking shape. Following several major studies of the 17th century Oirad over the past twenty years some fundamental issues remain unresolved. One key issue is the political status of the early 17th century Oirad. Confusions arise from conflicting sources and the absence of Oirat primary texts as well as from narratives influenced by the 19th century paradigm of primitive, kinship-based societies and the so-called pre-state polities into which they were organized. This fresh examination of the Oirad reframes the context in which the Oirad polity is discussed and looks to two 17th century Oirat texts to clarify the nature of the Oirad polity and the way in which the Oirad themselves viewed the state in which they lived. It concludes with a very different narrative of the early 17th century Oirad as a group heavily invested in building alliances and creating a new Buddhist state through a decentralized process of state building. That process resulted in the formation of a 17th century Oirad State with right and left wings that in 1640 co-created the Mongol-Oirat Great State that was unlike anything to come before it. It was a state without central authority other than the rule of law, founded not by conquest but by the mutual agreement of sovereign nobles. Some of those nobles came from aristocratic lineages that pre-dated Chinggis Khan and survived more than five hundred years of Chinggisid primacy to once again stand on equal ground.'}, {'categories': ['Science'], 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=JXWhBQAAQBAJ&dq=17th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'publisher': 'Springer Science & Business Media', 'subtitle': 'Essays on Scientific Reasoning', 'title': 'Rational Changes in Science', 'description': 'THE PROBLEMS OF SCIENTIFIC RATIONALITY Fashion is a fickle mistress.

They did so in a country, Indonesia, that was economically little developed and far away from any of the centres of European socialism and Asiatic radical-national ism. The ISDV was soon able to bring its influence to bear on sec tions of the urban proletariat and to build up an Indonesian revol utionary movement. This occurred in sharp competition with a nascent nationalist leadership, and then without the usual inter mediary role played by radicalizing groups of native intelligentsia. In this way, Dutch social democrats laid the foundations for one of the first communist parties in Asia and Africa, a party which was des tined to become one of the few communist mass parties of the Third World. However, in contrast to the major communist movements of China-Vietnam, this Indonesian party was to demonstrate a basic weakness: successive and catastrophic defeats. !

For a vertically stratified society equality of education had to be opposed be cause it would disturb an equilibrium as vital as that of a building. In the Middle Ages only the Church was able to look for new members at the bottom of the social ladder, since ecclesiastical office was not inherited by birth. But efforts in this direction were necessarily very limited, even if only because of the material obstacles to such an aim. Equality of education, as well as any other type of equality could not even be imagined by the aristocracy whose very existence would have been threatened. Its initial indifference was followed by active opposition. When it became possible to formulate the question of the diffusion of education, in the 17th and 18th centuries, the principle itself met with a fundamental objection. The ruling class, idle by its very nature, feared that the workers and especially those on the land would abandon their productive labours, now felt to be degrading, and swell the ranks of the parasites in the cities.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9789401024266', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=pvcLBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=pvcLBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '940102426X', 'pageCount': 164, 'authors': ['A.

The following is from the preface to that volume: During the past 15 years considerable progress has been made in the field of infertility diagnosis and management. It is perhaps a paradox that much of this increased knowledge has come about because of Western medicine's preoccupation with the search for a means to control reproduction. As a result, we have achieved new insights into the physiologic mechanisms involved in reproduction, and we have found better methods for measuring physiologic changes in reproductive health and disease. To these advances can be added improvements in the utilization of endoscopic and surgical techniques, in the diagnosis and treatment of infections and endometriosis, and in the treatment of hormonal disorders. During this period, too, through workshops and conferences and in journals and texts, these latest advances have been made available to physi cians, an outstanding example being the two volumes of Progress in Infer tility, edited by Drs. Jan Behrman and Robert Kistner.

Much confusion has arisen in the past through a neglect of the develop ment of Leibniz's ideas, and Couturat's impressive plea, in his edition of the Opuscu/es et fragments (p. xii), for such an arrangement is valid even for incomplete editions. The beginning student will do well, however, to read the maturer writings of Parts II, III, and IV first, leaving Part I, from a period too largely neglected by Leibniz criticism, for a later study of the still obscure sources and motives of his thought. The Introduction aims primarily to provide cultural orientation and an exposition of the structure and the underlying assumptions of the philosophical system rather than a critical evaluation.

Nor is it that half her national income is dependent upon world trade. Nor is it that so small a nation could achieve peace and prosperity with so little natural resources. What is most unusual is that the Netherlands has made such a rapid and total adjustment to the demands of modern technological society. In no small measure this was achieved by a deliberate policy of planning, direction, control and development. Its postwar history tells how a determined people under intelligent govern ment leadership rose from a broken economy to a level of economic and social development that places their society among the most modern in the world. The Netherlands is a success stor} that in some measure has been overlooked by a wider world. This will be an attempt to record her story, touching upon some of the causes and results of this success. The Netherlands is undoubtedly one of the most planning conscious of modern nations.

I have simply relied upon the text of Spinoza's own writings in an effort to grasp and to make intelligible to others the precise meaning of his doctrine, and to decide whether, in spite of numerous apparent and serious internal conflicts, it can be understood as a consistent whole. In so doing I have found it necessary to correct what seem to me t0' be mis conceptions frequently entertained by commentators. Whether or not I am right in my re-interpretation, it will, I hope, contribute something fresh, if not to the knowledge of Spinoza, at least to the discussion of what he really meant to say. The limits within which I am constrained to write prevent me from drawing fully upon the great mass of scholarly writings on Spinoza, his life and times, his works and his philosophical ideas.

Such an approach to God\'s existence is a variant of Thomas Aquinas\' fifth way. Its impact was secretly present in Einstein\'s famous saying: "God does not play dice," which, no doubt, used the word God in a merely figurative sense, and meant only: "nature does not result from a throw of the dice," yet the very fact implicitly postulated the existence of the divine Intellect.

In Chapter 1, P. C. Patton presents a tutorial survey of data organiza tion and access methods which play a central role in information system design. Research in information processing has been shifted from numerical data processing to nonnumerical information handling. In the latter case, the information is carried not only by the data but also by the structure and organization of the data base. In this chapter, the author provides the reader with a comprehensive review of various data structures, including linear lists, array structures, tree structures, and multilinked structures. He also discusses the important problem of data-base design and management. This chapter concludes with several examples of information handling systems such as a matrix interpretive system, a generalized information management system, and a criminal justice information system.

Over the years, the course has attracted national and international speakers and attenders of the highest calibre, plus up-to-the-minute reports on current research. In August 1984, the course was held, for the first time, in the beautiful old city of Chester. As always, the papers were presented by leading clinicians and researchers in their respective fields; once again, this included several contributions from Merseyside psychologists. Since 1981, the proceedings of this conference have been published as "Current Issues in Clinical Psychology". The present volume - Volume 4 - covers four major areas of current interest: The Child and Therapy; Rehabilitation Across the Specialties; New Directions for Psychology and the Law; and Addictive Behaviors. Each of these areas must be relevant to the work of almost all clinical psychologists, at various times. The volume closely reflects the order and content of papers presented at the 1984 conference, although it also includes one paper (by Guliz Elal-Lawrence) written specially for this publication.

Concert song clearly means the kind of songs one hears sung at concerts or recitals. Addressing myself to the general music-lover who, though he possesses no special knowledge of the song literature, is never theless interested enough in songs and their singers to attend recitals of Lieder or of songs in various languages, I have naturally confined myself to that period of time in which the vast majority of these songs was composed, though not necessarily only to those composers whose songs have survived to be remembered in recital programmes today.

Clements Center for Southwest Studies, Southern Methodist University. The Pueblo Revolt of 1680 is the most renowned colonial uprisings in the history of the American Southwest. Traditional text-based accounts tend to focus on the revolt and the Spaniards\' reconquest in 1692--completely skipping over the years of indigenous independence that occurred in between. Revolt boldly breaks out of this mold and examines the aftermath of the uprising in colonial New Mexico, focusing on the radical changes it instigated in Pueblo culture and society. In addition to being the first book-length history of the revolt that incorporates archaeological evidence as a primary source of data, this volume is one of a kind in its attempt to put these events into the larger context of Native American cultural revitalization. Despite the fact that the only surviving records of the revolt were written by Spanish witnesses and contain certain biases, author Matthew Liebmann finds unique ways to bring a fresh perspective to Revolt. Most notably, he uses his hands-on experience at Ancestral Pueblo archaeological sites--four Pueblo villages constructed between 1680 and 1696 in the Jemez province of New Mexico--to provide an understanding of this period that other treatments have yet to accomplish. By analyzing ceramics, architecture, and rock art of the Pueblo Revolt era, he sheds new light on a period often portrayed as one of unvarying degradation and dissention among Pueblos. A compelling read, Revolt\'s "blood-and-thunder" story successfully ties together archaeology, history, and ethnohistory to add a new dimension to this uprising and its aftermath.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9780816599653', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=0_8EFEnt_0wC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=0_8EFEnt_0wC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '0816599653', 'pageCount': 328, 'authors': ['Matthew Liebmann'], 'id': '0_8EFEnt_0wC'}, {'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'categories': ['Travel'], 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=1QLVpUuZ1a0C&dq=17th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'ISBN_13': '9781743213629', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1QLVpUuZ1a0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1QLVpUuZ1a0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '174321362X', 'publisher': 'Lonely Planet', 'authors': ['Lonely Planet', 'Helena Smith'], 'title': 'Lonely Planet Pocket Bruges & Brussels', 'description': "Lonely Planet: The world's leading travel guide publisher Lonely Planet Pocket Bruges & Brussels is your passport to all the most relevant and up-to-date advice on what to see, what to skip, and what hidden discoveries await you.

Conduits for both air and blood converge at the alveolar level to match ventilation with perfusion and thus assure the free diffusion of oxygen and carbon dioxide.

The strategic position of the alveolar region and its vast associated capillary network ensure its importance in the synthesis and degradation of a wide range of molecules. Finally, the alveoli have evolved important immune functions vital to protecting the host from a variety of inhaled pollutants and microorganisms.

It examines the role assigned to women in eighteenth-century society and the education thought fitting to perform it. It looks at attitudes to courtship and marriage, chastity and sexual passion. It explores the role of women as wives and mothers, as spinsters and widows, and focuses on the living and working experience of women whether in the home, agriculture, industry or domestic service. It contrasts the expectations of the rich and the poor, the leisured lady and the underpaid female agricultural labourer, the unmarried mother and the prostitute.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9780415623889', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ak02IMkrQEUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ak02IMkrQEUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '041562388X', 'pageCount': 271, 'authors': ['Bridget Hill'], 'id': 'ak02IMkrQEUC'}, {'categories': ['Travel'], 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=wcWG4-_DILAC&dq=17th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'publisher': "Fodor's", 'subtitle': 'with the Best City Walks and Scenic Day Trips', 'title': "Fodor's Rome", 'description': 'Rome is more than ever bursting at the seams with newly unleashed vitality.

They have done so generation after generation. These are peoples who make up bedrock nations throughout the world in whose territories the United Nations says 80 percent of the world’s life sustaining biodiversity remains. Once thought of as remnants of a human past that would soon disappear in the fog of history, indigenous peoples—as we now refer to them—have in the last generation emerged as new political actors in global, regional and local debates. As countries struggle with economic collapse, terrorism and global warming indigenous peoples demand a place at the table to decide policy about energy, boundaries, traditional knowledge, climate change, intellectual property, land, environment, clean water, education, war, terrorism, health and the role of democracy in society. In this volume Rudolph C. Ryser describes how indigenous peoples transformed themselves from anthropological curiosities into politically influential voices in domestic and international deliberations affecting everyone on the planet.

The question of solutions to the problems created by consumption and waste is raised and the claim is advanced that we do not necessarily need to stop being consumers.

Arnolphe, a narrow-minded merchant hoping to marry his young ward, Agnès, is obsessed with the fear of being made a cuckold. But all his artful plans serve only to speed him towards the fate he is so desperate to avoid. Molière himself first played the hapless merchant, and this believable character in an all too believable predicament both startled and delighted his public.

This is true because English spoken a millennium ago significantly differs from English spoken today. But how did it change and who were the in-novators who promoted language change in the course of time? It is the aim of the following research paper to show how and why the pronominal system changed from thou to you as the standard second person singular pronoun in the course of the Early Modern English period (1500-1700). More precisely, private correspondence from the 17th century will be examined to see why thou or you respectively were chosen and if it was one gender rather than the other who mainly contributed to the standard that we have today. The first chapter is going to shed light on Renaissance England and its demographical facts with particular emphasis on the role of women. General information will be included as well as some facts about family life, and most importantly, about education and literacy, which is imperative for language change found in written texts. The second chapter is going to investigate when, how and why a change in the pronominal system from thou to you occurred. In order to do so the concepts of power and solidarity as well as aspects of politeness theory will be considered. Chapter two is going to finish with a summary of assumptions about gender differences in pronoun usage. In chapter three a small-scale qualitative analysis of letters by female and male writers to family members will be carried out. The material is taken from the Corpus of Early English Correspondence (CEEC) as well as from the Helsinki Corpus (HC). It will be examined if the concepts brought forward in chapter two, e.g. affection or anger and matters of social stratification, e.g. super-/subordination played a role in language choice and, ultimately, language change.

Often many different minds worked together or built on the work of previous generations to achieve a working version of a great idea: Engineers explores this progression of ideas, from initial concept to prototype and finished design.

But Russia's territory has a harsh climate, is cut off from most maritime contact with the outside world, and has open and vulnerable land frontiers. It has therefore had to devote much of its wealth to the armed forces, and the sheer size of the empire has made it difficult to mobilise resources and to govern effectively, especially given the diversity of its people. In this Very Short Introduction, Geoffrey Hosking discusses all aspects of Russian history, from the struggle by the state to control society, the transformation of the empire into a multi-ethnic empire, Russia's relationship with the West/Europe, the Soviet experience, and the post-Soviet era. ABOUT THE SERIES: The Very Short Introductions series from Oxford University Press contains hundreds of titles in almost every subject area.

For three centuries after 1500, Muslim ships based in North African ports terrorized European shipping, capturing thousands of vessels and enslaving hundreds of thousands of Christians. Encountering Islam is the fascinating story of one Englishman's experience of life within a Muslim society, as both Christian slave and Muslim soldier. Born in Exeter around 1662, Joseph Pitts was captured by Algerian pirates on his first voyage in 1678. Sold as a slave in Algiers, he underwent forced conversion to Islam. Sold again, he accompanied his kindly third master on pilgrimage to Mecca, so becoming the first Englishman known to have visited the Muslim Holy Places. Granted his freedom, Pitts became a soldier, going on campaign against the Moroccans and Spanish before venturing on a daring escape while serving with the Algiers fleet. Crossing much of Italy and Germany on foot, he finally reached Exeter seventeen years after he had left. Joseph Pitts's A Faithful Account of the Religion and Manners of the Mahometans, first published in 1704, is a unique combination of captivity narrative, travel account and description of Islam. It describes his time in Algiers, his life as a slave, his conversion, his pilgrimage to Mecca (the first such detailed description in English), Muslim ritual and practice, and his audacious escape. A Christian for most of his life, Pitts also had the advantage of living as a Muslim within a Muslim society. Nowhere in the literature of the period is there a more intimate and poignant account of identity conflict. Encountering Islam contains a faithful rendering of the definitive 1731 edition of Pitts's book, together with critical historical, religious and linguistic notes. The introduction tells what is known of Pitts's life, and places his work against its historical background, and in the context of current scholarship on captivity narratives and Anglo-Muslim relations of the period.

The unlikely source text for these treatises was an advice book by King James the VIth and Ist to his son, Basilikon Doron. As an analysis of the translation and re-reading of a widely circulated text by the king of England and Scotland, the book is also a study in early modern cross-cultural dialogue, situated in the context of recent discussions on transculturalism, and more specifically on the intellectual connections between Britain and the world. The various contemporary translations of King James’s book to diverse contexts and languages enlisted it to different agendas, making it difficult to cast the process of translation and transmission as a story of a reception of an idea. They rather call attention to the importance of the local stakes involved in translation. How ideas originally formulated in a Scottish context came to be re-articulated in a Central European one is a particularly interesting story that provides us with a possibility to paint a picture of the various political languages in use at the time, from divine right arguments to elements of civic humanism, neostoicism, political Calvinism in its magisterial version, Old Testament biblicism and millenarianism.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9781443838573', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=LEcsBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=LEcsBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '1443838578', 'pageCount': 240, 'authors': ['Hanna Orsolya Vincze'], 'id': 'LEcsBwAAQBAJ'}, {'categories': ['Social Science'], 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=g4oQZqzFaJ0C&dq=17th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'publisher': 'SAGE Publications', 'subtitle': 'Theory and Practice', 'title': 'Criminal Justice Ethics', 'description': 'In the Third Edition of Criminal Justice Ethics, author Cyndi Banks once again examines the criminal justice system through an ethical lens identifying ethical issues in practice and in theory, exploring ethical dilemmas, and proposing means through which criminal justice professionals might resolve ethical issues and dilemmas.

Darwin's theory of evolution clearly demonstrated that evolution involved increasing organization. As we began to explore the molecular basis of life and its evolution, it became equally clear that it depended on the processing and communication of information. This book develops a consistent theory of evolution in its wider sense, examining the information based laws and forces that drive it. Exploring subjects as diverse as economics and the theories of thermodynamics, the author revisits the paradox of the apparent conflict between the laws of thermodynamics and evolution to arrive at a systems theory, tracing a continuous line of evolving information sets that connect the Big-Bang to the firms and markets of our current socio-economic system.", 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9781607509578', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=SCDvAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=SCDvAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '1607509571', 'pageCount': 232, 'authors': ['J.A.

In a few years he led his army as far as the gates of Vienna, made himself master of the Mediterranean and established his court in Baghdad. Faced with this redoubtable champion, who regarded it as his duty to extend the boundaries of Islam farther and farther, the Christian world struggled to unite against him. ‘The Shadow of God on Earth’, but also an expert politician and all-powerful despot, Suleiman ruled the state firmly with the help of his viziers. He extended the borders of the empire beyond what any of the Ottoman sultans had achieved, yet it is primarily as a lawgiver that he is remembered in Turkish history. His empire held dominion over three continents populated by more than thirty million inhabitants, among whom nearly all of the races and religions of mankind were represented. Prospering under a well-directed, authoritarian economy, Suleiman’s reign marked the apogee of Ottoman power. City and country alike experienced unprecedented economic and demographic growth. Istanbul was the largest city in the world, enjoying a remarkable renaissance of arts and letters; a mighty capital, it was the seat of the Seraglio and dark intrigue. ‘Clot’s informed and intelligent study is to be commended … Brings back to life a man, an empire and an era.’ Digest of Middle East Studies ‘Excellent ...

Howard and Brian J. Rogers. This work is much broader in scope than the previous books and includes mechanisms of depth perception by all senses, including aural, electrosensory organs, and the somatosensory system. Volume 1 reviews sensory coding, psychophysical and analytic procedures, and basic visual mechanisms. Volume 2 reviews stereoscopic vision. Volume 3 reviews all mechanisms of depth perception other than stereoscopic vision. The three volumes are extensively illustrated and referenced and provide the most detailed review of all aspects of perceiving the three-dimensional world. Volume 3 addresses all depth-perception mechanisms other than stereopsis. The book starts with an account of monocular cues to depth, including accommodation, vergence eye movements, perspective, interposition, shading, and motion parallax. A chapter on constancies in depth perception, such as the ability to perceive the sizes and shapes of objects as they move or rotate in depth, is followed by a chapter on the ways in which depth cues interact. The next chapter reviews sources of information, such as changing disparity, image looming, and vergence eye movements, used in the perception of objects moving in depth. Various pathologies of depth perception, including visual neglect, stereoanomalies, and albanism are reviewed. Visual depth-perception mechanisms through the animal kingdom are described, starting with insects and progressing through crustaceans, fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. The chapter includes a discussion of how stereoscopic vision may have evolved. The next chapter describes how visual depth perception is used to guide reaching movements of the hand, avoiding obstacles, and walking to a distant object. The next three chapters review non-visual mechanisms of depth perception. Auditory mechanisms include auditory localization, echolocation in bats and marine mammals, and the lateral-line system of fish. Some fish emit electric discharges and then use electric sense organs to detect distortions of the electric field produced by nearby objects. Some beetles and snakes use heat-sensitive sense organs to detect sources of heat. The volume ends with a discussion of mechanisms used by animals to navigate to a distant site. Ants find their way back to the nest by using landmarks and by integrating their walking movements. Several animals navigate by the stars or by polarized sunlight. It seems that animals in several phyla navigate by detecting the Earth's magnetic field.", 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9780199877362', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=3m2JAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=3m2JAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '019987736X', 'pageCount': 400, 'authors': ['Ian P.

Although writing (in his native Greek) in the second century AD, Aelian drew heavily on earlier works, such as Asclepiodotus, to put together a comprehensive manual of warfare in the Hellenistic period (late 3rd to early 1st centuries BC). His Tactica thus examines all facets of warfare in the period of Alexander the Great's successors, including the arms and armor of cavalry and infantry, formations, commands and signals. Aelian also provides a discussion of the Roman army of the period. As well as being an invaluable source for modern historians studying the Hellenistic period, the book was very influential on military theory long after Aelian's death. Arrian's work on tactics may merely be a revision of Aelian's; the Byzantine Emperor Leo VI used excerpts in his own treatise and an Arabic translation made around 1350 was used to train Muslim armies. Most significantly it became one of the primary training aids for the pike and musket armies of the 16 and 17th century Europe. A substantial edition published in London in 1616 contained a full direct translation as well as comprehensive notes and a treatise on how to apply Aelian's work to the training of English pike formations in the Macedonian manner. It was well used to train the foot regiments that fought the English Civil War. This unique longevity makes it of interest to anyone interested in warfare from the Hellenistic period right up to the English Civil War. Christopher Matthew's new edition is based on the 1616 edition but written in modern English with new renditions of all its accompanying figures. It has the original 1616 notes as well as comprehensive new notes and cross references to the other ancient manuals (such as Arrian and Leo) that drew upon it.

Its empirical backbone is a corpus analysis of the gradual replacement of stressed reflexive soi with the personal pronoun lui/elle from Old to Modern French. Apart from offering insights into the history of the language, this is important for current issues in theoretical linguistics, in particular binding, specificity, and the interaction of grammar and discourse. Within a cognitive-semantic framework, a number of analyses will help elucidate some long-standing puzzles in the study of French reflexives, while contributing to the wider theory of reflexivity and related issues.

These are peoples who make up bedrock nations throughout the world in whose territories the United Nations says 80 percent of the world's life sustaining biodiversity remains. Once thought of as remnants of a human past that would soon disappear in the fog of history, indigenous peoples—as we now refer to them—have in the last generation emerged as new political actors in global, regional and local debates. As countries struggle with economic collapse, terrorism and global warming indigenous peoples demand a place at the table to decide policy about energy, boundaries, traditional knowledge, climate change, intellectual property, land, environment, clean water, education, war, terrorism, health and the role of democracy in society. In this volume Rudolph C. Ryser describes how indigenous peoples transformed themselves from anthropological curiosities into politically influential voices in domestic and international deliberations affecting everyone on the planet.

It represents the culmination of Saikaku’s perceptive genius, and in structure, is one of the most consolidated of all his works. Most of the stories are told as incidents or episodes relating to New Year’s Eve, when in those days it was the custom to balance all debits and credits for the year. At this particular time of year, the drama of life reached its climax; there were tragedies, comedies, and farces. The players were of the nameless masses. But Saikaku portrays them so life-like a touch that, even though three centuries have passed since his time, it seems as if they were our contemporaries. Decidedly inclined towards the debtors, Saikaku has them slipping off to the homes of their favorite mistresses, leaving town on “sudden” business trips, or becoming actors for the day in order to deceive the ever-persistent year-end collectors. Some of his characters are successful, while some are beset by even more troubles in trying to avoid the collectors. The episodes are always frank, often with humor, and occasionally pathetic. But more than anything else, the seventeenth century day-to-day way of living by the commoners comes vividly to life as the old merchant centers of Edo, Osaka and Kyoto are laid open by the author’s unrelenting eye. In humorously probing into the lives of the masses at the year’s-end, Saikaku weaves a powerful social indictment as well as an absorbing series of tales.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9781462902606', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=iI7TAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=iI7TAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '146290260X', 'pageCount': 128, 'authors': ['lhara Saikaku'], 'id': 'iI7TAgAAQBAJ'}, {'categories': ['Art'], 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=JwXRAgAAQBAJ&dq=17th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'publisher': 'Tuttle Publishing', 'title': 'An Introduction to Netsuke', 'description': "NETSUKE artists have carved an imperishable niche for themselves in the hearts of collectors and connoisseurs everywhere. Among the many Japanese objets d'art, few have aroused greater admiration than the netsuke. This miniature piece of Japanese sculpture, approximately 1 1/2 inches in size, was designed (in the absence of pockets on kimonos) as an aid in suspending articles such as tobacco pouches from the sash of a kimono. It developed in ancient times as a utilitarian object, but became in the 16th century an artistic one as well, and flourished as such until 1926. No longer commonly worn, the netsuke is now a collectors' item, avidly sought throughout the world by those sensitive to its fme qualities. This book opens the miniature world of netsuke to those who have hitherto been unaware of its existence. In a delightfully lucid manner, the basics of the netsuke are presented-definition,origin, development, materials, statistics, and photographs. This book admirably fulfills its task of introducing the netsuke to the layman, irresistibly drawing him to new pleasures in aestheticism and culture.", 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9781462902378', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=JwXRAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=JwXRAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '1462902375', 'pageCount': 82, 'authors': ['Raymond Bushell'], 'id': 'JwXRAgAAQBAJ'}, {'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'categories': ['Cooking'], 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=5fxXUgPNe8AC&dq=17th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'ISBN_13': '9780984771516', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=5fxXUgPNe8AC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=5fxXUgPNe8AC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '0984771514', 'publisher': 'Macchiatone Communications', 'authors': ['Alon Halevy'], 'title': 'The Infinite Emotions of Coffee', 'description': "The Infinite Emotions of Coffee provides a contemporary prism of the drink that so much of the world takes for granted every morning.

The authors address the awkward silence on religion in nursing theory and education and with insightful scholarship move beyond the current level of knowledge and limited discourse on religion in nursing theory, education and practice. This book is path-breaking in that [it] gives many new ways to think about the relationships between ethics, health, caregiving, moral imagination, religion and spirituality." From the Foreword by Patricia Benner, PhD, RN, FAAN Professor Emerita of Nursing Department of Social and Behavioral Sciences and Nursing University of California, San Francisco The past 25 years have witnessed an escalating discussion on the role of spirituality within health care. This scholarly volume is rooted in the belief that not only is religion integral to nursing care, but the religious beliefs of both nurse and patient can significantly influence care and its outcome. It offers an in-depth analysis of the ways in which religion influences the discipline of nursing, its practitioners, and treatment outcomes. Through the contributions of an international cadre of nurse scholars representing the world\'s major religious traditions, the book explores how theories, history and theologies shape the discipline, bioethical decision making, and the perspective of the nurse or patient who embraces a particular religion. It examines the commonalities between the values and thinking of nursing and religion and identifies basic domains in which additional research is necessary. The authors believe that ultimately, scholarly dialogue on the relationship between religion and nursing will foster and enhance nursing practice that is ethical and respectful of personal values. Key Features: Offers in-depth analysis of how religion influences the discipline of nursing, its practitioners, and treatment outcomes Uses critical theories to explore the intersections of religion, ethics, culture, health, gender, power, and health policy Includes an overview of all major world religions Focuses on the implications of religion for nursing practice rather than nursing interventions Designed for graduate and upper-level undergraduate students, nurse academicians and clinicians', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9780826106643', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=YoNJVn2ihTwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=YoNJVn2ihTwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '0826106641', 'pageCount': 432, 'authors': ['Marsha D.

In Christian cultures, the worth of the female sex is highly ambivalent, since virginity and motherhood are construed respectively as badges of purity and fruitfulness, whilst the biological processes which underlie them are considered taboo or impure. Throughout history, women are in turn represented as inferior, defective creatures or as privileged ‘empty vessels’ in their relationship with the divine. This polarized conception of woman has influenced the way in which religious institutions, learned writers, or indeed women themselves consider the female personal and collective relationship with the supernatural, with the divine, and with the institutions which represent it. Through eleven original essays, this volume questions how women from the English-speaking world have negotiated their roles in the spiritual and religious spheres. From early-modern Catholics and Puritan groups to twenty-first century nuns, Anglican ministers and Mormons, how did women define their roles in male-dominated institutions? How did they react to the public perceptions of their bodies as either incompatible with or facilitating access to the divine? The questions at the core of this book hinge upon the articulation between the female self (body and soul) and its experience of the preternatural, of faith, and of institutionalized groups. Are there specific forms of female spirituality and do they lead to a feminized/feminist conception of God?', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9781443834896', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=sCYrBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=sCYrBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '1443834890', 'pageCount': 255, 'authors': ['Laurence Lux-Sterritt', 'Claire Sorin'], 'id': 'sCYrBwAAQBAJ'}, {'categories': ['Medical'], 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=Qe70fMvSmOoC&dq=17th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'publisher': 'Oxford University Press', 'title': 'Clinical Neuropsychology', 'description': 'Since its first publication in 1979, Clinical Neuropsychology has been a valued resource for students and scientists interested in brain-behavior relationships.

After the proof of the Prime Number Theorem in 1896, a quick development of analytical tools led to the invention of various new methods, like Brun's sieve method and the circle method of Hardy, Littlewood and Ramanujan; developments in topics such as prime and additive number theory, and the solution of Fermat’s problem. Rational Number Theory in the 20th Century: From PNT to FLT offers a short survey of 20th century developments in classical number theory, documenting between the proof of the Prime Number Theorem and the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem. The focus lays upon the part of number theory that deals with properties of integers and rational numbers. Chapters are divided into five time periods, which are then further divided into subject areas. With the introduction of each new topic, developments are followed through to the present day.

Initially forcing a passage between high, rugged moorland hills, it then breaks free to wind through gentler countryside south of Settle, meandering lazily through alternating pasture and ancient woodland, where old manor houses and early 18th-century village cottages still hold sway against the pervasive tide of modernity.

These studies—while providing a useful insight into the contributions of a few more or less well-known figures—have mostly focused, however, on the obstacles that women have had to overcome in the field of education and employment or in their quest for acknowledgement by their male peers. The aim of this volume is to try and approach the issue from a different and more comprehensive point of view, taking into account not only the position of women in science, but also the link between women and science through the analysis of various kinds of discourse and representation such as the press, poetry, fiction, biographies and autobiographies or professional journals—including that of women themselves. The questions of the presentation or re(-)presentation of science by women are thus at the core of this study, as well as that of the portrayal and self-portrayal of women in the sciences (whether in the educational, or the professional field).

The Misfortunes of Alonso Ramírez described the incredible adventures of a poor Spanish American carpenter who was taken captive by British pirates near the Philippines and forced to work for them for two years. After circumnavigating the world, he was freed and managed to return to Mexico, where the Spanish viceroy commissioned the well-known Mexican scholar Carlos de Sigüenza y Góngora to write down Ramírez's account as part of an imperial propaganda campaign against pirates. The Misfortunes of Alonso Ramírez has long been regarded as a work of fiction—in fact, as Latin America's first novel—but Fabio López Lázaro makes a convincing case that the book is a historical account of real events, albeit full of distortions and lies. Using contemporary published accounts, as well as newly discovered documents from Spanish, English, French, Portuguese, and Dutch archives, he proves that Ramírez voyaged with one of the most famous pirates of all time, William Dampier. López Lázaro's critical translation of The Misfortunes provides the only extensive Spanish eyewitness account of pirates during the period in world history (1650–1750) when they became key agents of the European powers jockeying for international political and economic dominance. An extensive introduction places The Misfortunes within the worldwide struggle that Spain, England, and Holland waged against the ambitious Louis XIV of France, which some historians consider to be the first world war.", 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9780292744738', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_edNo_t46nMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_edNo_t46nMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '0292744730', 'authors': ['Fabio López Lázaro'], 'id': '_edNo_t46nMC'}, {'categories': ['Fiction'], 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=ozd5Rgzz40oC&dq=17th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'publisher': 'Xlibris Corporation', 'subtitle': 'Book II Mid 17th Century', 'title': 'AMOROUS ADVENTURES OF A TIME TRAVELLER', 'description': 'After surviving 10 years in each of the 18th and 19th Centuries, enjoying affairs with the ladies of these era.

A Harem of Fondled Hatred”: An Historical Interrogation of Sexual Violence against Women in Film explores the pernicious nature of rape in films from the silent era to the 21st century. Film is an excellent medium through which to hold this discussion, because film, like the body, as Judith Butler, et al. suggest, is fluid and indeterminate, and it is often contemplated as a site for negotiation and resistance. This book addresses three major questions: (1) why does rape persist as a recurring theme in film, (2) how is this subject manifested in film and (3) what does this manifestation say about the act of rape itself, its victims, its perpetrators and our culture? Rape is a sexual manifestation of aggression with the purpose of overpowering, humiliating, and hurting its victims. An examination of media accounts has revealed that before the evolution of feminist film theory and the dismissal of the Production Code, the rape victim in films usually fits into one “neat” set of criteria (e.g., young adult, white, single, middle class, heterosexual). When the victim’s physical makeup deviated from the traditional set of criteria (e.g., a child or a mature person of color, married, poor, homosexual), the rape was portrayed more violently. The research for this book dwells on the portrayal of the latter type of victims because their sexual violations evoke an absorbing commentary on society’s reaction toward those who do not easily fit within the status quo. What is it about the makeup of these victims that makes their violations more horrific?', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9781443830775', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=gQorBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=gQorBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '1443830771', 'pageCount': 175, 'authors': ['Deveryle James'], 'id': 'gQorBwAAQBAJ'}, {'categories': ['Science'], 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=DUlt0htkZZgC&dq=17th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'publisher': 'Cambridge University Press', 'subtitle': 'From Its Institution to the End of the Eighteenth Century', 'title': 'History of the Royal Society', 'description': "The Royal Society has been dedicated to scientific inquiry since the seventeenth century.

The dissertation examines the content of Lasallian pedagogical spirituality and proposes measures for realizing its vitality within Lasallian school life. Particular pedagogical characteristics, components of an overall pedagogical spirituality, are present in the original charism of St. John Baptist de La Salle. The basic operative commitments that underlie those characteristics ought to be integrally realized in a pedagogy that claims to be Lasallian and wholly incorporated in the formation of Lasallian educators. There are three sequential parts to the dissertation: 1) an overview of the St. John Baptist de La Salle's context and personal history, 2) an overview of his literature followed by an analysis of aspects of Lasallian pedagogical spirituality evidenced in that literature according to five pedagogical elements: the teacher, the student, the teacher/student relationship, the activity of teaching, and the school in general, and 3) a contemporary articulation of the Lasallian basic operative commitments that characterize his spirituality today, along with their implications for the formation of Lasallian educators Extrapolating from the life and writings of De La Salle, ten Lasallian operative commitments are proposed. The commitments are presented in the form of attributes that may be applied to Lasallian institutions and their pedagogical components: 1) centered in and nurtured by the life of faith, 2) trusting providence in discerning God's will, 3) with creativity and fortitude, 4) through the agency the Holy Spirit, 5) incarnating Christian paradigms & dynamics, 6) with practical orientation, 7) devoted to education, accessible and comprehensive, 8) committed to the poor, 9) working in association, 10) expressing a lay vocation.

The German Reception of Samuel Richardson's Pamela, or Virtue Rewarded (1740) as a Novelistic Model for 18hc Germany", 'description': 'La publicación de este volumen representa un caso relativamente insólito. Un pequeño grupo de jóvenes investigadores de menos de treinta años convence a un grupo mucho más numeroso de la misma edad para celebrar en Salamanca la First Conference of Young Researchers on Anglophone Studies. El resultado es deslumbrante. No solo demuestran una gran capacidad organizativa, sino que los resultados individuales de las aportaciones científicas son sobresalientes. Este volumen, Current Trends in Anglophone Studies, recoge una selección revisada de las propuestas presentadas en el Encuentro y gira en torno a una estructuración tripartita clásica: estudios culturales, lingüísticos y literarios. En ella caben todos aquellos que se mueven en el campo de los estudios anglófonos. Cada uno de estos campos podría haber sido suficiente para celebrar un congreso, pero parece razonable que en este tipo de encuentros tengan cabida todos. De ese modo, este volumen se convierte en un ejemplo de aproximación interdisciplinar a los estudios anglófonos. Desde un punto de vista cuantitativo, los estudios culturales ocupan sin duda un espacio menor. Sin embargo, sobresale la variedad de temas tratados, así como la internacionalización de los autores, dentro de este apartado. Estudiantes españoles e italianos acometen estudios relacionados con la música, la pintura, el cine, la traducción, la marginalidad social o el impacto de las nuevas tecnologías en la producción artística. Si no pareciera demasiado atrevido, podría decirse que estos jóvenes estudiosos irían más allá de lo que un día ya lejano pudieron imaginar Richard Hoggard o Raymond Williams. Los estudios aquí presentados reflejan, sin duda, la evolución que la propia sociedad ha experimentado en estos últimos cincuenta años y exploran la relación entre las prácticas culturales, la vida diaria, y los contextos económicos, políticos e históricos. No es de extrañar que una gran parte de las contribuciones presentadas en este volumen se centren en el estudio de la lengua, ya que la demanda del inglés se ha incrementado de forma considerable en los últimos años. Sobresalen los análisis puramente filológicos y sobre todo los relacionados con el aprendizaje del inglés como segunda lengua. Por eso, destacan estudios que contemplan rasgos morfológicos, léxicos o sintácticos. Sin embargo, el mayor número de participaciones hace referencia al ya citado aprendizaje del inglés como L2, tanto desde el análisis de materiales, como desde la práctica oral o escrita. Las contribuciones literarias ofrecen una evaluación teórica, formal e interpretativa de distintas tendencias desde perspectivas tanto interdisciplinares como interculturales. Cronológicamente los estudios abarcan textos desde el siglo XVIII hasta nuestros días, con un acento especial en los autores más contemporáneos y en el género narrativo. En general estos estudios se fijan en textos concretos y los analizan desde perspectivas culturales, sociológicas o psicológicas. Pero abundan menos las aproximaciones desde la teoría literaria, desde la técnica narrativa o, como tal vez cabría esperar al tratarse de estudiantes tan jóvenes, desde la aplicación de las nuevas tecnologías. Por el contrario, se repiten temas como los traumas heredados de la Guerra de Vietnam, las cicatrices del 11 de septiembre o los problemas de género. En definitiva, se trata de una selección de artículos claramente prometedora, que transmite la seguridad de que el futuro de la Filología Inglesa está en buenas manos y podrá experimentar una positiva evolución en los próximos años. Por todo ello, hay que felicitar a todos los participantes individuales y, sobre todo, a los organizadores del evento, y editores de este volumen, que han demostrado una enorme capacidad de trabajo y de saber hacer.'}, {'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=kjd0aKY1YZ4C&dq=17th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'ISBN_13': '9781603846981', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=kjd0aKY1YZ4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=kjd0aKY1YZ4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '1603846980', 'pageCount': 208, 'publisher': 'Hackett Publishing', 'authors': ['Richard Ligon', 'Karen Ordahl Kupperman'], 'title': 'A True and Exact History of the Island of Barbados', 'description': "As the one major, book-length English chronicle and natural history of the Caribbean published in the seventeenth century, written at the time of experimental adoption of the sugar / African slavery complex that would come to characterise the Caribbean for two hundred years, to such disastrous effects, Ligon's True & Exact History of the Island of Barbados is a -- if not the -- central text that records and, in part, worries over this transformation.", 'id': 'kjd0aKY1YZ4C'}, {'categories': ['Music'], 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=nhlwAgAAQBAJ&dq=17th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'publisher': 'Oxford University Press', 'title': 'The Performance of 16th-Century Music: Learning from the Theorists', 'description': "Most modern performers, trained on the performance practices of the Classical and Romantic periods, come to the music of the Renaissance with well-honed but anachronistic ideas.

Centuries later, as the construction industry faces up to its environmental responsibilities, this book explores its rich and ancient tradition to provide tried and trusted solutions to modern day construction problems. By way of introduction, the ancient and historical lifestyles that dictated the nature of traditional construction are explored, before focussing on its health and ecological benefits. As well as cultural background, this book includes a detailed scientific description of traditional building materials and their constituents which draws a sharp contrast with modern petrochemical-based materials. The studies of traditional buildings included reveal the sustainability of features such as natural ventilation and breathing walls, and comparisons with modern construction methods show how they could prevent 'sick building syndrome'. The author argues that maintenance for long life, by contrast with the modern concept of life-cycle costing, is at the nub of sustainability and underlies the contribution traditional building construction can make to tackling climate change. Over 250 original photos, and over fifty bespoke diagrams illustrate the features, techniques, and characteristics of traditional construction that could make such a valuable contribution to the industry today. The inclusion of a close study of how these methods relate to British building regulations makes this book a practical guide for construction professionals, as well as an authoritative resource for students and policy-makers.", 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9781134034628', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=UKZgdwZ7X1wC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=UKZgdwZ7X1wC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '1134034628', 'pageCount': 384, 'authors': ['Carole Ryan'], 'id': 'UKZgdwZ7X1wC'}, {'categories': ['Games'], 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=LzD9zULwGkQC&dq=17th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'publisher': 'Osprey Publishing', 'title': 'Clash of Empires', 'description': "Covering Eastern Europe during the Renaissance, and Western Europe in the latter half of the 16th century, Clash of Empires, the third Field of Glory: Renaissance companion provides aspiring generals with everything they need to command an army of steadfast Janissaries, or the troops of one of the Ottoman Empire's foes.

Professor Gipouloux has combined historical studies on global maritime seas with regional economic studies on Asia. He also integrates historical interaction between maritime seas and coastal port cities by creating the imaginative geo-economical concept of the East Asian economic corridor , running between Vladivostok and Singapore and locating China, Japan and Southeast Asia into this maritime area. To attain this goal, Professor Gipouloux globalises China through north south, east west and past present combinations, using cross-disciplinary approaches political economy, geography and international relations under wide historical perspectives. The Asian Mediterranean opens a new horizon to look into Asia from a global perspective and at the same time reminds us of the connection beyond contrast between East and West. Takeshi Hamashita, Tokyo University, Japan and Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China A fascinating analysis of the proposition that the start of the 21st century is witnessing the rapid rise in South East Asia of a new and powerful transnational economic zone, the Asian Mediterranean. It uses a wide range of historical and contemporary multidisciplinary sources to systematically explore how, why, and in what ways we can better interpret and understand this contemporary version of economic globalisation by looking back to the equivalent processes centred on the ports around the Mediterranean and the Baltic seas during the late 16th century. Peter Daniels, University of Birmingham, UK François Gipouloux has written a vast and comprehensive history of the Asian economic system. In the tradition of Braudel, he paints a picture that is detailed, full of insight, and essentially very long term. On the basis of an analysis of the old Mediterranean and Hanseatic economic networks, he surveys the pre-modern Asian system, bringing it up to date with studies of Yokohama, Hong Kong, Singapore and other Asian hubs. The culmination of many years work, Gipouloux throws light on a new China a China no longer land based and inward looking but dependent on, and a power in, a maritime world. Christopher Howe, University of London, UK Gipouloux s ground-breaking study based on a long career as a scholar of Asia s past is a most original contribution to the study of globalization. Connecting past and present, the author has further developed the somewhat vague metaphor of an Asian Mediterranean into a well-defined concept that can also be applied to analyzing contemporary affairs. While in the past the traditional Chinese and Japanese state systems were failing to formulate adequate answers, on a more informal level the port cities were able to meet with the maritime challenges of the emerging modern world system. The author convincingly shows how also in the age of globalization, a string of coastal metropolises continues to be instrumental in opening up the Far Eastern economy to the global economy. Leonard Blusse, Leiden University, The Netherlands This insightful book draws upon a wide range of disciplines political economy, geography and international relations to examine how Asia has returned to its central position in the world economy. As in the case of the hosting of the Olympic games, it is cities rather than states which compete, whether as financial centres, logistical hubs or platforms for coordinating international subcontracting. Analysing the historical precedents of the Mediterranean maritime republics, the Baltic Sea Hanseatic League and the South China Sea mercantile kingdoms, the book delineates the way stable economic and legal institutions were developed largely beyond the purview of, and at times in conflict with, the State.

By their very nature, traditions are diverse. This is particularly the case with theological traditions, even including those cases where they have been named for a single individual (e.g. Augustinianism, Thomism, Lutheranism, and Calvinism). In the eras of the Reformation and of Reformed orthodoxy there was intense theological debate, leading to confessional identity and confessional boundaries; hence the Remonstrant controversy in the early seventeenth century. What the essays of this volume look at, however, are the debates that took place within the Reformed theological tradition, particularly within Puritan England. Some of the debates considered here threatened to rise to a confessional level whereas others were not so serious insofar as they did not press on confessional boundaries. The Puritan tradition surveyed in these essays looks at both major and minor intra-Reformed debates. Most of these debates analyzed have been passed over in the older scholarship in its quest to find the few true Calvinians to oppose to the so-called Calvinists. By contrast, none of the studies included in the present volume brands one side of a seventeenth-century debate as un-Calvinian or identifies an alteration of doctrinal perspective as a declension from Reformation-era purity. Calvin no longer appears as a norm, although he does appear, with other Reformers, as an antecedent of certain lines of argument. Lastly, the essays document the ongoing concern among Reformed theologians to further the Reformation cause. In this pursuit, Reformed theologians, as they did during the time of the Reformation theologians, often found themselves disagreeing on a number of theological doctrines. - Publisher.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9783525569450', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=RhyUM8sfWlAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=RhyUM8sfWlAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '3525569459', 'pageCount': 336, 'authors': ['Michael A.

In particular, it focuses on the emergence of the financial centres of Tokyo, Shanghai, Hong Kong and Singapore and the attempts by both national governments and the private sector to position them so that they become more competitive in the global and regional context. The volume shows much historical sensitivity showing that while the increase in the importance of these financial centres is principally post 1945, their emergence has been aided by the deep historical roots that go back several centuries. The book will be of great value in the interpretation of the role of East Asia in what many commentators have called the "Asian Century".\' – Terry McGee, The University of British Columbia, Canada \'Gateways to Globalisation cogently demonstrates that Hong Kong, Singapore, Beijing, Shanghai, and Tokyo operate as gateways to Asia and as linchpins for Asia to the global economy. The authors\' theoretical frameworks and original empirical research support provocative findings that challenge conventional thinking. Tokyo may decline as a global city. As Beijing and Shanghai ride China\'s rapid growth they face uncertainty about its future openness to the global economy. Vibrant Hong Kong and Singapore confront challenges from other rising centers.\' – David Meyer, Washington University in St Louis, US \'This book distinguishes itself in its emphasis on historical and cultural links as well as contemporary globalization processes on large East Asian cities. Arising from a research program and four seminars, the editor has picked scholars who can relate past and present trends. Historical links of Japanese cities are explored. Leading world cities in the region are analysed in their evolution from entrepôts to modern gateways, service integrators, transport hubs and financial centres. It is a study of the integration and interrelationships of East Asian cities in the global economy.\' – Yue-man Yeung, Chinese University of Hong Kong Asia\'s trading and financial hubs have become global cities which frequently have more in common and closer linkages with each other than with their corresponding hinterlands. As this book expounds, these global cities illustrate to what extent world trends deeply penetrate and permeate the national territorial interiors and processes that were otherwise presumed to be controlled by the State. Gateways to Globalisation is soundly based on accurate and extensive research (including perspectives from historians, economists, geographers and sociologists) from China, Japan, Singapore and Hong Kong, in order to grasp the regional character of trade and finance, beyond national borders and traditional academic frameworks. The book documents that today, major urban centres such as Tokyo, Beijing, Singapore, Hong Kong and Shanghai situated on the periphery of the maritime corridor of East Asia, form a system characterised by the intensity of their economic linkages and integration into the world economy. Since the mid-1980s, these major Asian cities have become the worldwide-oriented centres for production, trade, finance and research. This collective effort offers, in addition to its regional framework, up-to-date information that strengthens an original trans-disciplinary analysis of a region and its economic characteristics, which will be of interest to readers within academia and beyond. This well-detailed and thorough work will interest academics and post-graduate students in economics, geography, finance, history, regional studies and Asian studies, as well as those who have a general interest in globalisation.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9780857934253', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=I_HjO6fdI4EC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=I_HjO6fdI4EC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '0857934252', 'pageCount': 288, 'authors': ['Fran�ois Gipouloux'], 'id': 'I_HjO6fdI4EC'}, {'categories': ['Computers'], 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=Eb-J3D7UqWAC&dq=17th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'publisher': 'World Scientific', 'title': 'Fundamentals of Quantum Information', 'description': 'This book provides an introduction to the basic ideas and concepts of quantum computation and information for both undergraduate and graduate students.

It consists of 19 essays by some of the leading historians, archeologists and ethnographers of the region, with seminal contributions by Jean-Pierre Warnier, Paul Nchoji Nkwi, Bongfen Chem-Langhee, Phyllis Kaberry, E.M Chilver, Miriam Goheen, Ian Flower, Dan Lantum and V.G. Fanso. The book covers a broad range of themes from precolonial times to date, including trade, alliances, diplomacy, the iron industry, colonial impact, continuities, discontinuities and compromise, general persistence, ideology and conflict. Warnier draws on linguistic and archaeological data to argue that this region has been settled for several millennia, very probably continuously, and that its landscapes are very ancient and have resulted from many human and natural forces other than the simple clearance of the forest cover of the region at an uncertain date as some authors have postulated. Using data on inter-group diplomacy and alliances, Nkwi puts into question some problematic theses on persistence hostilities and enhances knowledge of the precolonial history of the region. Fowler and Chem-Langhee show how local conditions and needs fostered the spirit and practice of cooperative ventures in the precolonial period, which provided the driving force and the ideological and structural underpinnings for the successful and smooth introduction of modern modes of cooperation in the area during the colonial and postcolonial periods. The rest of the studies have a unifying theme or thesis, namely, that despite the entry and assault of external, influences, particularly those associated with colonialism, Christianity and Islam, the traditional institutions, customs and value systems of the Nso' and their neighbours have resisted major change and their total corrosion is not yet in sight. The volume illustrates the proposition that historical research is a continuous process of rediscovery which provides new questions, and also that the evidence of other disciplines - linguistics, archaeology and palaeobotany for example - may give rise to many new lines of inquiry and help to correct the documentary record and explain oral tradition.

From the 9th-century AD onwards, the secular rulers of Tibet sought to extend their influence, and that of Buddhism, throughout the region. To this end, huge stone and mud-brick fortifications, known as dzongs, were constructed to dominate the secular landscape, while massive Buddhist monasteries dominated the religious - both following a very specific style of Tibetan architecture. It has been estimated that as many as 3,000 monasteries were built along with 200 dzongs. Mongol invasions from the 12th century onwards provided another influence, while internecine fighting in the 17th century led to increased fortification of the monasteries and the rise of the Dalai Lama as the head of a theocracy in Tibet, centred on the Potala Palace in Lhasa - a true fusion between secular dzong and religious monastery. Elsewhere in the Tibetan-influenced Himlayas the Buddhist Indian Kashmiri kingdom of Ladakh withstood assaults by both Muslims and Sikhs and developed a style of fortress monastery located on rocky peaks for defence, these often became combined with the fortified palaces of the rulers of Ladakh.

They almost certainly landed on the northwest coast by sea from the nearby islands of the Indonesian archipelago. That first arrival may have been replicated many times over. The following exploration and settlement of a vast and varied continent was a venture of heroic proportions. The new settlers had reached southern Tasmania, the point farthest from the original landfall at least 30,000 years ago. By the early 17th century, when the first European seafarers arrived in Australian waters, the Aboriginal nations were living in every part of the continent, having colonized the tropical rainforests of the north, the vast arid deserts of the interior, and the cool and damp woodlands of the southeast. The Historical Dictionary of Australian Aborigines relates the history of Australia's indigenous inhabitants from their arrival on the continent 60,000 years ago to the centuries long European colonization process starting in the 1600s to their role in today's Australia. This is done through a chronology, an introductory essay, an extensive bibliography, and over 300 cross-referenced dictionary entries on significant persons, places, events, institutions, and aspects of culture, society, economy, and politics.

The question of solutions to the problems created by consumption and waste is raised and the claim is advanced that we do not necessarily need to stop being consumers.

It\'s easy to think of piracy as a romantic way of life long gone-if not for today\'s frightening headlines of robbery and kidnapping on the high seas. Pirates have existed since the invention of commerce itself, but they reached the zenith of their power during the 1600s, when the Mediterranean was the crossroads of the world and pirates were the scourge of Europe and the glory of Islam. They attacked ships, enslaved crews, plundered cargoes, enraged governments, and swayed empires, wreaking havoc from Gibraltar to the Holy Land and beyond. Historian and author Adrian Tinniswood brings alive this dynamic chapter in history, where clashes between pirates of the East-Tunis, Algiers, and Tripoli-and governments of the West-England, France, Spain, and Venice-grew increasingly intense and dangerous. In vivid detail, Tinniswood recounts the brutal struggles, glorious triumphs, and enduring personalities of the pirates of the Barbary Coast, and how their maneuverings between the Muslim empires and Christian Europe shed light on the religious and moral battles that still rage today. As Tinniswood notes in Pirates of Barbary, "Pirates are history." In this fascinating and entertaining book, he reveals that the history of piracy is also the history that shaped our modern world.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9781101445310', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=IBSVMivndEQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=IBSVMivndEQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '1101445319', 'pageCount': 368, 'authors': ['Adrian Tinniswood'], 'id': 'IBSVMivndEQC'}, {'categories': ['Political Science'], 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=5wBzAwAAQBAJ&dq=17th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'publisher': 'SAGE Publications', 'title': '21st Century Political Science: A Reference Handbook', 'description': 'Request a free trial of SAGE Knowledge to sample this title and many more! www.sagepub.com/freetrial Via 99 entries or "mini-chapters," the SAGE 21st Century Reference Series volumes on political science highlight the most important topics, issues, questions, and debates any student obtaining a degree in this field ought to have mastered for effectiveness in the 21st century. 21st Century Political Science: A Reference Handbook serves as an authoritative reference source that meets students\' research needs with more detailed information than encyclopedia entries but not so much jargon, detail, or density as a journal article or a research handbook chapter.

Excerpt: Oscar Fingal O'Flahertie Wills Wilde (16 October 1854 30 November 1900) was an Irish writer, poet, and prominent aesthete. His parents were successful Dublin intellectuals, and from an early age he was tutored at home, where he showed his intelligence, becoming fluent in French and German. He attended boarding school for six years, then matriculated to university at seventeen years of age. Reading Greats, Wilde proved himself to be an outstanding classicist, first at Trinity College, Dublin, then at Magdalen College, Oxford. After university, Wilde moved around trying his hand at various literary activities: he published a book of poems and toured America lecturing extensively on aestheticism.

In traditional historiography, women’s articulation is often marginalized and dominated by male voices. Through centuries of patriarchal control, women negotiated many layers and levels of existence working out different forms of resistance which have often gone unnoticed. Bhakti was one such medium. Religion provided the space in the medieval period and women saints embraced bhakti to define their own truths in voices that question society, family and relationships. For all these women bhaktas, the rejection of the male power that they were tied to in subordinate relationship became the terrain for struggle, self assertion and alternative seeking. Most of these women lived during the period from 12th to 17th Century. While the dominant mode of worship in bhakti was prostration to a deity like a feudal lord, the women bhaktas’ idea of God as a lover, a husband and a friend came as a breath of fresh air. The individual outpourings and the voices of these women, who had the courage to sing unfettered in their own voices, refused to melt in the din of the feudal scene which was largely patriarchal. This book will be useful to scholars interested in Feminist History, Comparative Religion and Asian Studies.

Drawing on recent developments in political economy theories and in the generation of empirical measures of the extent of price distortions, the present volume provides both analytical narratives of the historical origins of agricultural protectionism in various parts of the world and a set of political econometric analyses aimed at explaining the patterns of distortions that have emerged over the past five decades. These new studies shed much light on the forces affecting incentives and those facing farmers in the course of national and global economic and political development.

There - with silver mined in Peru - Europeans would purchase, by the thousands, the porcelain so often shown in Dutch paintings of this time.

In each of these works, the author emphasizes the role of the experimental method in exploring the laws of Nature, that is to say, the way in which an experiment is designed, implemented according to tried and tested te- niques, and used as a basis for drawing conclusions that are based only on results, with their margins of error, taking into account contemporary traditions and prejudices. Two centuries later, Claude BERNARD, in his Introduction to the Study of Experimental Medicine, made a passionate plea for the application of the experimental method when studying the functions of living beings. Twenty-first century Biology, which has been fertilized by highly sophisticated techniques inherited from Physics and Chemistry, blessed with a constantly increasing expertise in the manipulation of the genome, initiated into the mysteries of information techn- ogy, and enriched with the ever-growing fund of basic knowledge, at times appears to have forgotten its roots.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9789048137671', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=LzOgYPcbivoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=LzOgYPcbivoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '9048137675', 'pageCount': 418, 'authors': ['Pierre V.

This new book takes the content related to the doctrine of salvation from that original work arranging it in logical order in a more reader-friendly fashion.

The first three decades of her life were the eventful times of World War I and its after effects, the great depression, and World War II. After that, the story continues of her search for love and to provide love, which left her a young widow with five small children to raise, having also lost a set of twins. These disasters did not crush her, but through them all she learned to enjoy the small things in life which gave her great joy and pleasure. She learned to live within her means on a meagre pension. She was blessed with the second love of her life and the responsibilities of a larger family that came along with it, followed by many more years of life lived on her own, but with the added blessing of coins of gold to share those years with. In "Coins of Gold", see, hear and learn from the worth of a woman of gold.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9781453519912', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=U50P3s9ZuLgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=U50P3s9ZuLgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '1453519912', 'pageCount': 155, 'authors': ["Barbara Raue'"], 'id': 'U50P3s9ZuLgC'}, {'categories': ['Social Science'], 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=fsF1AwAAQBAJ&dq=17th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'publisher': 'SAGE Publications', 'title': '21st Century Anthropology: A Reference Handbook', 'description': 'Request a free 30-day online trial at www.sagepub.com/freetrial Via 100 entries or "mini-chapters," 21st Century Anthropology: A Reference Handbook highlights the most important topics, issues, questions, and debates any student obtaining a degree in the field of anthropology ought to have mastered for effectiveness in the 21st century.

The cathedral was built in sections from 1573 to 1813 around the original church that was constructed soon after the Spanish conquest of Tenochtitln, eventually replacing it entirely. Spanish architect Claudio de Arciniega planned the construction, drawing inspiration from Gothic cathedrals in Spain.

Eric Flint, the Reigning Master of Alternate History, Returns to the Series He Created in 1632 for the Most Exciting Entry Yet in the Ring of Fire Saga. The Thirty Years War continues to ravage 17th century Europe, but a new force is gathering power and influence: the United States of Europe, a new nation led by Gustavus Adolphus, King of Sweden, and the West Virginians from the 20th century led by Mike Stearns who were hurled centuries into the past by a mysterious cosmic accident. While the old entrenched rulers and manipulators continue to plot against this new upstart nation, everyday life goes on in Grantville, even under the shadow of war, as this lost outpost of American freedom and justice must play David against a 17th century Goliath of oppressive feudalism. Praise for the New York Times Best-Selling Series: “. . . gripping and expertly detailed . . . a treat for lovers of action-SF or alternate history . . . battle scenes depicted with power . . . distinguishes Flint as an SF author of particular note, one who can entertain and edify in equal, and major, measure.” —Publishers Weekly (in a starred review) “[This] alternate-history saga . . . is certainly a landmark in that subgenre. . . .

Here, exquisitely photographed by Ingalill Snitt, are the eight houses (and one church) that he has acquired over more than 40 years. The book focuses on Sjöberg's first, most complex project: the manor of Regnaholm. Unoccupied for about 40 years when Sjöberg arrived in 1966, it allowed him to experiment with interior decoration and refurnishing, copying old furniture, reweaving, and reprinting old fabric patterns. His other projects include Ekensberg, a three-story Italianate villa near Lake Mälaren, built in 1788-90, and Salaholm in Västergötland with a garden laid out in the first half of the 17th century. Odenslunda, a small manor from the 1770s with a panelled exterior and a säteritak or manor-house roof, is his family home, while Sörby, a scaled-down early 17th-century manor house, was reproduced in its entirety for an exhibition in Stockholm. Full of insight and inspiration, this is a deeply personal summary of everything Lars Sjöberg has learned in his years of working and living with classic Swedish interiors.", 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9780711230880', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=t9S82uKGp8IC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=t9S82uKGp8IC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '0711230889', 'pageCount': 205, 'authors': ['Lars Sjöberg', 'Lars Sjoberg', 'Ingalill Snitt'], 'id': 't9S82uKGp8IC'}, {'categories': ['History'], 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=3iv_ugAACAAJ&dq=17th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'publisher': 'Books LLC, Wiki Series', 'subtitle': '17th Century in Angola, 17th Century in Australia, 17th Century in Austria, 17th Century in Belgium, 17th Century in Brazil, 17th Century in Bulgaria, 17th Century in Canada, 17th Century in Chile, 17th Century in China', 'title': '17th Century by Country', 'description': "Please note that the content of this book primarily consists of articles available from Wikipedia or other free sources online.

Excerpt: The Age of Discovery began with the voyage of Christopher Columbus c. 1492. It is characterised by European colonisation of missionary activity. During the Age of Discovery, the Roman Catholic Church established a number of Missions in the Americas and other colonies in order to spread Christianity in the New World and to convert the indigenous peoples. At the same time, missionaries such as Francis Xavier as well as other Jesuits, Augustinians, Franciscans and Dominicans were moving into Asia and the Far East. The Portuguese sent missions into Africa. While some of these missions were associated with imperialism and oppression, others (notably Matteo Ricci's Jesuit mission to China) were relatively peaceful and focused on integration rather than cultural imperialism.

His achievements include improvements to the telescope and consequent astronomical observations, and support for Copernicanism. Galileo has been called the "father of modern observational astronomy," the "father of modern physics," the "father of science," and "the Father of Modern Science."

The first three decades of her life were the eventful times of World War I and its after effects, the great depression, and World War II. After that, the story continues of her search for love and to provide love, which left her a young widow with five small children to raise, having also lost a set of twins. These disasters did not crush her, but through them all she learned to enjoy the small things in life which gave her great joy and pleasure. She learned to live within her means on a meagre pension. She was blessed with the second love of her life and the responsibilities of a larger family that came along with it, followed by many more years of life lived on her own, but with the added blessing of coins of gold to share those years with.

Italian opera is both the art of opera in Italy and opera in the Italian language. Opera was born in Italy around the year 1600 and Italian opera has continued to play a dominant role in the history of the form until the present day. Many famous operas in Italian were written by foreign composers, including Handel, Gluck and Mozart. Works by native Italian composers of the 19th and early 20th centuries, such as Rossini, Bellini, Donizetti, Verdi and Puccini, are amongst the most famous operas ever written and today are performed in opera houses across the world. This book traces the growth of opera in Italy including opera seria, Don Giovanni, the marriage of Figaro, and Tosca.

Excerpt: The Battle of Vienna (German: Schlacht am Kahlenberg, Polish: Bitwa pod Wiedniem or Odsiecz Wiede?ska, Turkish: ?kinci Viyana Ku?atmas?, Ukrainian: / Vid?ns'ka Vidsi?) took place on 11 and 12 September 1683 after Vienna had been besieged by the Ottoman Empire for two months. It was a battle of The Holy League versus the Ottoman Empire and fiefdoms of the Ottoman Empire near the Kahlenberg mountain in Vienna. The battle marked the beginning of the political hegemony of the Habsburg dynasty in Central Europe. The Viennese army was led by Ernst R diger Graf von Starhemberg subordinate of Leopold I Habsburg, Holy Roman Emperor. The large-scale battle was won by Polish-Lithuanian, Hungarian, Austrian and German forces commanded by King of Poland Jan III Sobieski versus the Ottoman Empire army and the Ottoman fiefdoms armies commanded by Grand Vizier Merzifonlu Kara Mustafa Pasha. The siege itself began on 14 July 1683, by the Ottoman Empire army of approximately 150,000 men.

Excerpt: Connection Timeout William Byrd (1540 or late 1539 - 4 July 1623) was an English composer of the Renaissance. He wrote in many of the forms current in England at the time, including various types of sacred and secular polyphony, keyboard (the so-called Virginalist school) and consort music. Our knowledge of Byrd's biography has expanded in recent years, thanks largely to the research of John Harley (Harley, 1997). Following the discovery of a document dated 2 October 1598 in which Byrd's age is given as '58 years or there about's it now appears that he was born in 1540. The older dating 1542-3 is derived from Byrd's will (endorsed on 22 November 1622) which describes him as 'in the 80th year of my age'. It now becomes clear that it must have been drafted about three years earlier than the date of endorsement. Byrd was born in Lincoln, the son of a Thomas Byrd (not Thomas Byrd of the Chapel Royal) about whom little is known. Byrd had two brothers, Symon'd and John, and four sisters. It is clear from a reference in the prefatory material in the Tallis/Byrd Cantiones of 1575 that Byrd was a pupil of Thomas Tallis, then the leading c...", 'id': 'y6oXYAAACAAJ'}, {'categories': ['History'], 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=QUBKG6hoCOEC&dq=17th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'publisher': 'Oxford University Press, USA', 'title': 'Tudor Stuart Britain and the Wider World, 1485-1685: Oxford Bibliographies Online Research Guide', 'description': 'This ebook is a selective guide designed to help scholars and students of the ancient world find reliable sources of information by directing them to the best available scholarly materials in whatever form or format they appear from books, chapters, and journal articles to online archives, electronic data sets, and blogs.

The earliest activity was a small, temporary camp, which belonged to a band of Mesolithic hunter-gatherers. After a hiatus, activity recommenced in the middle Bronze Age. Features of this date comprised three burnt mounds, two waterholes, two trough-like pits and a possible cremation burial. Jennett's Park was first used for permanent settlement during the middle Iron Age, when a small farmstead was established. The settlement was occupied into the late Iron Age, but was abandoned and replaced by an agricultural landscape defined by a complex of field boundary ditches. The field system continued in use into the Roman period until the early 2nd century AD. Evidence was found at the northern end of the investigations for 11th/12th-century curvilinear stock enclosures, which were superseded by a system of fields and enclosures that were in use until the mid 14th century. Their abandonment in the 14th century was possibly associated with the creation of Easthampstead Park.

Excerpt: The Eighty Years\' War, or Dutch War of Independence, (15681648) began as a revolt against Philip II of Spain, the overlord of the Habsburg Netherlands. The war ended with the Treaty of Westphalia. This revolt partly succeeded with the secession of seven provinces which formed the Dutch Republic. The direct cause of this war was similar to the slogan No taxation without representation. Under the Habsburgs, the low countries were formally named unceremoniously De landen van herwaarts over, and in French Les pays de par dea. Translated, this means "those lands around here" for the Dutch, and "those lands around there" for the French. While they were being taxed beyond what they were willing to pay, these far-away provinces were being continually admonished for seeing to their own business without permission from the throne, which at that time was indeed far away, in Spain. Each request for special permission would take at least four weeks for a response. This unrest over taxation without representation was amplified by a strong presence of ...

At different points in its history, Denmark\'s boundaries have encompassed England, Sweden, West Africa, India, and the West Indies. Despite its changing and relatively small boundaries, Denmark has played a much larger part in the politics of Europe than might be expected. Additionally, through its territories (Faroe Islands and Greenland), Denmark has managed to retain an important presence in the North Atlantic. Today, democratic Denmark, with its thriving capital Copenhagen, is peaceful, prosperous, and progressive. Within NATO, Denmark has contributed to peace-keeping in the Persian Gulf and Bosnia. The "Danish Model" of welfare gives Danes a real sense of social security and presents many naysayers with a provocative example of a successfully managed welfare state. Danes have a reputation for inventiveness and good design, whether in architecture, furniture, or industrial design. The A to Z of Denmark relates the history of this successful country through a chronology, an introductory essay, appendixes, a bibliography, and hundreds of cross-referenced dictionary entries on kings, politicians, officials, explorers, authors, architects, composers, painters, astronomers, educationists, reformers, political parties, social movements, and other aspects of Danish society.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9781461671848', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=msxKvluMkh4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=msxKvluMkh4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '1461671841', 'pageCount': 564, 'authors': ['Alastair H.

Yet his large nose has convinced him that no woman would ever be interested in him. When Cyrano finds that Roxanne is enamored with the handsome Christian de Neuvillette, he offers to use his poetic prowess to help Christian win Roxanne’s heart.

Excerpt: The Royal Prussian Army (German: ) was the army of the Kingdom of Prussia. It was vital to the development of Brandenburg-Prussia as a European power. The Prussian Army had its roots in the meager mercenary forces of Brandenburg during the Thirty Years' War. Elector Frederick William developed it into a viable standing army, while King Frederick William I of Prussia drastically increased its size. King Frederick the Great led the disciplined Prussian troops to victory during the 18th century Silesian Wars and increased the prestige of the Kingdom of Prussia. The army was outdated by the beginning of the Napoleonic Wars, and Prussia was defeated by France in the War of the Fourth Coalition. However, under the leadership of Gerhard von Scharnhorst, Prussian reformers began modernizing the Prussian Army, which contributed greatly to the defeat of Napoleon Bonaparte during the War of the Sixth Coalition. Conservatives halted some of the reforms, however, and the army subsequently became a bulwark of the conservative Prussian government. The Prussian Army was successful in 19th century wars against Denmark, Austria and France, allowing Prussia to unify Germany and create the German Empire in 1871. The Prussian Army formed the core of the Imperial German Army, which was replaced after World War I with the Reichswehr.

Excerpt: Alexander Edward (10 June 1651 16 November 1708) was a Scottish Episcopalian clergyman, who later became a draughtsman, architect and landscape designer . He was a stylistic follower of Sir William Bruce, and planned several gardens in the grand French axial manner.Early life Alexander Edward was the eldest son of Robert Edward, minister at Murroes in Angus, who was related by marriage to the Maule family, and as such enjoyed the patronage of the Maule Earls of Panmure . Alexander's diary records that his family had to hide from Cromwell's Puritan troops in the 1650s, and also that he had a squint . He graduated from the University of St Andrews in 1670. Edward was not ordained until 1679, and his activities during the 1670s are unknown. At this time, his father was writing a description of Angus, and preparing a map to accompany the book, entitled Angusia, Provincia Scotiae . The work was commissioned by George Maule, 2nd Earl of Panmure, and published in 1678. John Lowrey has suggested that Alexander assisted with Angusia, acquiring skills as a draughtsman and cartographer. Lowrey also speculates that he may have come into contact with Sir William Bruce at this time, as Bruce designed new gates for Panmure House in 1672. Edward was one of the pallbearers at the funeral of Archbishop Sharp, the churchman murdered by Presbyterian Covenanters in 1679. From 1681 he was minister of Kemback in Fife, until 1689 when he was deprived of his parish as a non-j...", 'id': 'GT-RSQAACAAJ'}, {'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'pageCount': 130, 'ISBN_13': '9781157996590', 'ISBN_10': '1157996590', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=4Z6nSgAACAAJ&dq=17th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'publisher': 'Books LLC', 'authors': ['LLC Books'], 'title': 'Centuries in Chile: 16th Century in Chile, 17th Century in Chile, 18th Century in Chile, 19th Century in Chile, 20th Century in Chile', 'description': 'Purchase includes free access to book updates online and a free trial membership in the publisher\'s book club where you can select from more than a million books without charge.

The exact start of the war is a matter of dispute among historians, with some attributing the Bolivian presidential decree of Hilarin Daza as a declaration of war, and others attributing Chile as the first nation to officially declare war and invade foreign territory.

Excerpt: Empress Myeongseong (19 October 1851 8 October 1895), also known as Queen Min, was the first official wife of King Gojong, the twenty-sixth king of the Joseon dynasty of Korea. In 1902, she received the posthumous name Hyoja Wonseong Jeonghwa Hapcheon Honggong Seongdeok Myeongseong Taehwanghu (Korean Hangul:, Hanja: ), often abbreviated as Myeongseong Hwanghu (Hangul:, Hanja: ), meaning Empress Myeongseong. The Japanese considered her as an obstacle against its overseas expansion. Efforts to remove her from the political arena, orchestrated through failed rebellions prompted by the father of King Gojong, Heungseon Daewongun (an influential regent working with the Japanese), compelled the Empress to take a harsher stand against Japanese influence. After Japan's victory in the First Sino-Japanese War, Queen Min advocated stronger ties between Korea and Russia in an attempt to block Japanese influence in Korea, which was represente...More: http: //booksllc.net/?id=426049", 'id': 'oAmsSgAACAAJ'}, {'categories': ['Medical'], 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=myWDPdQFapQC&dq=17th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'averageRating': 3.0, 'publisher': 'John Wiley & Sons', 'title': 'An Anthropology of Biomedicine', 'description': '"By convincingly articulating critical medical anthropology and social studies of science, analyzing questions emerging from the most recent technologies in medicine and reflecting on public health issues in developing countries, this book will become a reference for social scientists and more broadly for all those interested in contemporary changes and challenges."

Original and compelling - it is a stunning achievement." Veena Das, Johns Hoplcins University "Because Lock and Nguyen take seriously the ongoing co-constitution of diverse biological and social bodies-human, microbial, and more-they have written a timely, densely ethnographic, theoretically astute, and necessary book. This book proposes an anthropology of biomedicine as technology that can better contribute to actually realizing health as a basic human right globally." Donna Haraway, University of California, Santa cruz "An Anthropology of Biomedicine introduces biomedicine from an anthropological perspective, exploring the entanglement of material bodies with history, environment, culture, and politics. Focusing on the ways in which the application of biomedical technologies bring about radical changes to societies at large, medical anthropologist Margaret Lock and physician and medical anthropologist Vinh-Kim Nguyen advance the theory that the human body in health and illness is not an ontological given but a moveable, malleable entity that is the elusive product of nature and culture. Tracking the historic global application of biomedical technologies, the authors reveal the intended and unintended local consequences and the exacerbation of global inequalities and health disparities that such technologies bring about.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9781405110723', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=myWDPdQFapQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=myWDPdQFapQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '1405110724', 'pageCount': 506, 'authors': ['Margaret Lock', 'Vinh-Kim Nguyen'], 'id': 'myWDPdQFapQC'}, {'categories': ['Literary Criticism'], 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=KSEZLZNc3r8C&dq=17th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'publisher': 'OUP Oxford', 'title': 'French Literature: A Very Short Introduction', 'description': 'The heritage of literature in the French language is rich, varied, and extensive in time and space; appealing both to its immediate public, readers of French, and also to a global audience reached through translations and film adaptations. The first great works of this repertory were written in the twelfth century in northern France, and now, at the beginning of the twenty-first century, include authors writing in many parts of the world, ranging from the Caribbean to Western Africa. French Literature: A Very Short Introduction introduces this lively literary world by focusing on texts - epics, novels, plays, poems, and screenplays - that concern protagonists whose adventures and conflicts reveal shifts in literary and social practices. From the hero of the medieval Song of Roland to the Caribbean heroines of I, Tituba, Black Witch of Salem or the European expatriate in Japan in Fear and Trembling, these problematic protagonists allow us to understand what interests writers and readers across the wide world of French. ABOUT THE SERIES: The Very Short Introductions series from Oxford University Press contains hundreds of titles in almost every subject area. These pocket-sized books are the perfect way to get ahead in a new subject quickly.

Excerpt: James Ussher (sometimes spelled Usher) (4 January 1581 - 21 March 1656) was Church of Ireland Archbishop of Armagh and Primate of All Ireland between 1625-56. He was a prolific scholar, who most famously published a chronology that purported to establish the time and date of the creation as the night preceding Sunday, 23 October 4004 BC, according to the proleptic Julian calendar. Ussher was born in Dublin, Ireland, into a well-to-do Anglo-Irish family. His maternal grandfather, James Stanihurst, had been speaker of the Irish parliament, and his father Arnold Ussher was a clerk in chancery who married Margaret Stanihurst.

The ambition is to show in how far an analysis of visual elements in late Renaissance culture contributes to our understanding of the cultural products of that era.

Social and cultural currents in Renaissance are equally important for the process of creation as are the experiences of the individual. Based on this theoretical background I’d like to establish a connection between the self-portraits John Donne commissioned during his lifetime and the influence of contemporary painters and art collectors. The chapter will allow us a deeper insight into Donne’s affection for visual arts and image. Above that it allows us to go even further and explore the meaning of performance, staging and courtly festivals as part of the visual culture surrounding the poet. In conclusion of the preceding chapters I’d like to apply the results on the textual-level of Donne’s work.

The volume contains contributions from top international scholars working in the fields of, for example, historical correspondence, seventeenth- and eighteenth-century print news, sixteenth-century liturgy and political discourse, the language of quack doctors, late modern travel writing, personal notebooks, and even the eighteenth-century public discourse of shopping.

This is a critical review of some of the English writings and quotes regarding those interactions that were contemporary to the time that the English were colonizing the area. The major event that defined this time was King Philip’s War from 1675 through 1676 which resulted in the crushing defeat of the natives who lived in that part of New England. The primary story in Mary’s Master centers upon the captivity of one of the English women during that war, Mary Rowlandson. Her narrative is considered to be the most widely read American captivity story ever written. The accounts of other English captives reveal behavior by the natives that shows humanity in great contrast with the savagery attributed to them by most contemporary writers. Mary Rowlandson’s “master” is, Quanopin, a Narragansett sachem whom Mary admires despite all the anti-Indian rhetoric she has been exposed to by others. While their time together is brief, it is exceptional because she expresses an admiration for him not conveyed toward any other Indian, which was unusual for those times and still is today.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9781440188183', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NnBlmYirdLsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NnBlmYirdLsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '1440188181', 'pageCount': 192, 'authors': ['Leonard P.

This works is divided into three main parts. The first section serves as an introduction to the main topic and provides the reader with background information about the political, social, religious and literary situation during that time. It presents a review of the tumultuous succession of the English throne, the rising Puritan movement throughout the century and the development of English theatre after the era of the Elizabethan Stage at the end of the sixteenth century. The second part describes women’s role in the patriarchal society of the seventeenth century and the difficulties of their every-day life. It also points out the obstacles and difficulties women encountered when trying to enter the male-dominated literary world and names Aphra Behn and Katherine Philips as two women, who, nevertheless, established themselves as successful female writers. Finally, the third and last part of this paper is dedicated to the prolific writer Margaret Cavendish, Duchess of Newcastle. It contains an overview of her life and work and especially examines her as the first woman to publish her own natural philosophy, for which she was criticized by many of her contemporaries.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9783640556113', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Qe1mmI_a4HUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Qe1mmI_a4HUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '3640556119', 'pageCount': 17, 'authors': ['Luise Ihlo'], 'id': 'Qe1mmI_a4HUC'}, {'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=HoLMqCssSBoC&dq=17th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'ISBN_13': '9783640556489', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=HoLMqCssSBoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=HoLMqCssSBoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '3640556488', 'pageCount': 24, 'publisher': 'GRIN Verlag', 'authors': ['Luise Ihlo'], 'title': 'Female Authorship in the 17th Century England at the Example of Margaret Cavendish', 'description': 'Seminar paper from the year 2010 in the subject English Language and Literature Studies - Literature, grade: 1,3, University of Leipzig (Institut fur Anglistik), course: Culture and Literature of 17th century England, language: English, comment: Kommentar des Dozenten: very informative, well-structured, some concepts should be elaborated, abstract: Contents Introduction', 'id': 'HoLMqCssSBoC'}, {'categories': ['History'], 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=2P12mlSqYXIC&dq=17th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'publisher': 'iUniverse', 'subtitle': 'Colonization and the Indians in 17th Century New England', 'title': "Mary's Master", 'description': "Mary's Master provides observations and interpretations of the English colonization of the area presently known as southern New England. This is a critical review of some of the English writings and quotes regarding those interactions that were contemporary to the time that the English were colonizing the area. The major event that defined this time was King Philip's War from 1675 through 1676 which resulted in the crushing defeat of the natives who lived in that part of New England. The primary story in Mary's Master centers upon the captivity of one of the English women during that war, Mary Rowlandson. Her narrative is considered to be the most widely read American captivity story ever written. The accounts of other English captives reveal behavior by the natives that shows humanity in great contrast with the savagery attributed to them by most contemporary writers. Mary Rowlandson's master is, Quanopin, a Narragansett sachem whom Mary admires despite all the anti-Indian rhetoric she has been exposed to by others. While their time together is brief, it is exceptional because she expresses an admiration for him not conveyed toward any other Indian, which was unusual for those times and still is today.", 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9781440188176', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2P12mlSqYXIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2P12mlSqYXIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '1440188173', 'pageCount': 192, 'authors': ['Leonard P.

It is commonly believed that Christianity was introduced to Japan by the Spanish and Portuguese missionaries during the 1500s; however, Samuel Lee draws on various forms of cultural, religious and linguistic evidence to argue that Christianity was introduced to Japan through the Lost Tribes of Israel, who were converted to Christianity through the missionary efforts of the Assyrian Church of the East around A.D. 500. Much of the evidence he discusses has become submerged into many Japanese folkloric songs, festivals and is to be found in temples. There are, for example, approximately 300 words in Japanese and Hebrew/Aramaic that are similar. Further, Dr. Lee outlines the history of Catholicism in Japan during the 1500s, the systematic persecution of Christians from 1600s to the 1800s, and the rise of Protestant Church in Japan. The historical portion of the book ends with an analysis and discussion of 21st century Japanese society. Lastly, in Rediscovering Japan, Reintroducing Christendom, Samuel Lee questions the missiological methods of Western Christianity and advocates an approach based in dialogue between Christianity and other cultures.", 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9780761849506', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=LKj2B9vd7HsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=LKj2B9vd7HsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '0761849505', 'pageCount': 210, 'authors': ['Samuel Lee'], 'id': 'LKj2B9vd7HsC'}, {'categories': ['Travel'], 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=M3MTVqXvOooC&dq=17th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'publisher': 'Penguin', 'title': 'DK Eyewitness Travel Guide: Germany', 'description': 'With beautifully commissioned photographs, and spectacular aerial views revealing the charm of each destination, these amazing travel guides show what others only tell.

While he did not write as much as others, his principle works, Critique of Pure Reason, Critique of Practical Reason, and Critique of Judgment, are known worldwide. During his time, schools of Kantianism quickly sprang up and were later joined by schools of Neokantianism. Admittedly, not all of Kant's concepts have aged well, but many are still taught among the basics of philosophy today and therefore must be known by every student. The A to Z of Kant and Kantianism provides a comprehensive dictionary that will aid not only students, but also teachers and the general public, since it contains hundreds of entries describing Kant's life and works, and explaining his concepts as well as the contributions of his followers (and also some opponents). Furthermore, much of the writings of the Neokantians, as well as the literature dealing with this movement, are not available in English, thus, this book provides an introduction to this phenomenon to the English-language reader. Given the inevitable problems of language, the glossary is particularly helpful, while the bibliography makes the massive amounts of literature more accessible.", 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9781461731818', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=u0YhG2Az67YC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=u0YhG2Az67YC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '146173181X', 'pageCount': 416, 'authors': ['Helmut Holzhey', 'Vilem Mudroch'], 'id': 'u0YhG2Az67YC'}, {'categories': ['Political Science'], 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=zoBrcrIQ-N4C&dq=17th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'publisher': 'John Wiley & Sons', 'subtitle': 'Presiding Officers and the Management of Business from the Middle Ages to the Twenty-first Century', 'title': 'Speakers and the Speakership', 'description': 'This volume explores the role of the Speaker and the Lord Chancellor in the Westminster Parliament before the advent of democracy, setting it beside the practice at Dublin and Edinburgh over the same period, and the more recent history of the role at London and Washington.

Modern agriculture, urban expansion, industry and transport have all left their mark, altering the face of the countryside forever. Shifting with the changing scene, the fortunes of Britain and Ireland\'s bird populations have fluctuated dramatically over the years. As current farming practices have evolved, the natural habitats and breeding patterns of many species have been disrupted. Urban and industrial growth has brought with it the pressures of new land use, pesticides, pollution and human interference. The activities of sportsmen, collectors and farmers have also taken their toll over the years. The new Poyser title The Historical Atlas of Breeding Birds in Britain and Ireland 1875-1900 is a fascinating book resulting form years of meticulous research by the author, Simon Holloway, who provides an absorbing account of the distribution changes of Britain and Ireland\'s birds over the last quarter of a century. Large colour distribution maps and their accompanying text paint a species-by-species picture of a period which completely transformed the landscape of this country. It is, says Natural World magazine, "a classic case of \'why did no one write this book before?\'...The experienced birder, using a knowledge of species requirements, can only marvel at what the long-vanished landscapes were then like." Birdwatch praises Simon Holloway\'s achievement, saying: "This book brings together so much information from disparate sources, and its status maps present such a clear picture of our late Victorian avifauna, that it should take its place beside the BTO atlases on the bookshelf." While Birdwatching adds: "If you are interested in the historical side of birds and their populations this book will be an endless source of fascination."

This encyclopedia covers 100 events in world history from the 17th century to the present--moments that alone were major and minor, but ones that exploded in the public eye when the media stepped in. Topics covered include yellow journalism, the War of the Worlds radio broadcast, the Kennedy-Nixon debates, JFK\'s assassination, the Pentagon papers, and Hurricane Katrina. These are events that changed the way the media is used--not just as a tool for spreading knowledge, but as a way of shaping and influencing the opinions and reactions of America\'s citizens. Thanks to the media\'s representations of these events, history has been changed forever. From classified military plans that leaked out to the public to the first televised presidential debates to the current military tortures caught on tape, "100 Media Moments That Changed America" will demonstrate not only an ever-evolving system of news reporting, but also the ways in which historical events have ignited the media to mold news in a way that resonates with America\'s public. This must-have reference work is ideal for journalism and history majors, as well as for interested general readers. Chapters are in chronological order, beginning with the 17th century. Each chapter starts with a brief introduction, followed by media event entries from that decade. Each entry explains the moment, and then delivers specific details regarding how the media covered the event, America\'s response to the coverage, and how the media changed history.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9780313355172', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=mqLDcaW2K18C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=mqLDcaW2K18C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '0313355177', 'pageCount': 229, 'authors': ['Jim Willis'], 'id': 'mqLDcaW2K18C'}, {'categories': ['Social Science'], 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=RtshtNAeSvMC&dq=17th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'publisher': 'Wageningen Academic Pub', 'subtitle': 'A Short History of Dutch Agriculture, 1500-2000', 'title': 'Five Centuries of Farming', 'description': 'Where the lower reaches of the rivers Rijn, Maas and Schelde have passed through the Northwest-European plain to finally flow out into the North Sea, a unique country of towns had come about during the Late Middle Ages. Since then, due to its natural and central location, this country, the Netherlands, has turned into a true crossroads of European trade connections between east and west, north and south. A highly urbanised country emerged and as the urban economies prospered they have had a great impact on the surrounding countryside. This in turn has affected the rural communities and has stimulated all kinds of agrarian activities. Highly productive agribusiness complexes have been the result. Today experts rank Dutch agriculture and horticulture as one of the most productive in the world. Milk production per cow and arable farming and horticulture, productivity per man-hour is amongst the highest known. This book is meant to give an overview of the historical processes of five centuries of farming and it makes clear that the old farming society was only seemingly static.

Excerpt: Portuguese Restoration War (Portuguese: ) was the name given by nineteenth-century 'romantic' historians to the war between Portugal and Spain that began with the Portuguese revolution of 1640 and ended with the Treaty of Lisbon (1668). The revolution of 1640 ended the sixty-year period of dual monarchy in Portugal and Spain under the Spanish Habsburgs. The period from 1640 to 1668 was marked by periodic skirmishes between Portugal and Spain, as well as short episodes of more serious warfare, much of it occasioned by Spanish and Portuguese entanglements with non-Iberian powers. In the seventeenth century and afterwards, this period of sporadic conflict was simply known, in Portugal and elsewhere, as the Acclamation War. The war established the sovereignty of Portugal's new ruling dynasty, the House of Braganza, by deposing a foreign king, Philip IV of Spain, and acclaiming another one, Jo o IV of Portugal, who was more legitimate and suitable to the Portuguese. This ended the so-called Iberian Union. John IV of Portugal, the restored kingWhen Philip II of Portugal (known as Philip III in Spain) died, he was succeeded by Philip III (Philip IV of Spain) who had a different approach to Portuguese issues.

Excerpt: John Amos Comenius (Czech: Slovak: German: Polish: Hungarian: Latinized: Iohannes Amos Comenius) (28 March 1592 - 4 November 1670) was a Czech teacher, educator, and writer. He served as the last bishop of Unity of the Brethren, and became a religious refugee and one of the earliest champions of universal education, a concept eventually set forth in his book Didactica Magna. He is considered the father of modern education. He lived and worked in many different countries in Europe, including Sweden, the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, Transylvania, the Holy Roman Empire, England, the Netherlands, and Royal Hungary. Comenius originated from Moravia, but history has no accurate record of his birthplace. There are three possible locations: Kom a, Nivnice, or Uhersk Brod (all three locations are in Uhersk Hradi t District, southeastern Moravia, Czech Republic). His ancestors came from Hungary (likely from the part that is today Slovakia, which is very close to Moravia in location as well as in language) during the 16th century and his original family name was Szeges according to his will found in 1968 by Milada...', 'id': 'PSfObwAACAAJ'}, {'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'categories': ['Literary Collections'], 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=HYfOYgEACAAJ&dq=17th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'ISBN_13': '9781240886456', 'ISBN_10': '1240886454', 'pageCount': 326, 'publisher': 'British Library, Historical Print Editions', 'authors': ['Julia Addison'], 'title': 'Isabel St Clair, a Romance of the 17th Century', 'description': "Title: Isabel St. Clair, a romance of the 17th century.Publisher: British Library, Historical Print EditionsThe British Library is the national library of the United Kingdom.

During his time, schools of Kantianism quickly sprang up and were later joined by schools of Neokantianism. Admittedly, not all of Kant's concepts have aged well, but many are still taught today among the basics of philosophy. Holzhey and Mudroch provide a comprehensive dictionary that will aid not only students but also teachers and the general public, with hundreds of entries describing Kant's life, works, and concepts, as well as the contributions of his followers and opponents. Furthermore, much of the writings of the Neokantians and the literature dealing with this movement are not available in English, thus The A to Z of Kant and Kant and Kantianism provides an introduction for the English-language reader.

Excerpt: The Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (or Union, since 1791 the Commonwealth of Poland) was a dualistic state of Poland and Lithuania ruled by a common monarch. It was the largest and one of the most populous countries of 16th- and 17th century Europe with some 400,000 square miles (1,000,000 km) and a multi-ethnic population of 11 million at its peak in the early 17th century. It was established at the Union of Lublin in July 1569, and was destroyed by the Third Partition of Poland in 1795. The Union possessed features unique among contemporary states: its political system was characterized by strict checks upon monarchical power. These checks were enacted by a legislature (Sejm) controlled by the nobility (szlachta). This idiosyncratic system was a precursor to modern concepts of democracy, constitutional monarchy and federation. The two component states of the Commonwealth were formally equal, yet Poland was the dominant partner in the union. The Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth was marked by high levels of ethnic diversity and by relative religious tolerance guaranteed by Warsaw Confederation Act 1573, though the degree of religious tolerance varied over time. After several decades of prosperity, it entered a period of protracted political, military and economic decline. Its growing weakness led to its partitioning among its more powerful neighbors, Austria, Prussia and the Russian Empire, during the late 18th century. Shortly before its demise, the Commonwealth adopted a massive reform effort and enacted the Constitution of May 3, 1791, described by Norman Davies as the first of its kind in Europe. The official name of the Commonwealth was The Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania (Polish: ...', 'id': 'y6VOYgEACAAJ'}, {'categories': ['Social Science'], 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=Y7Qgfj3Y7XcC&dq=17th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'publisher': 'Taylor & Francis', 'subtitle': 'An Invitation', 'title': 'Social Work and Social Welfare', 'description': "Like the first edition of Social Work and Social Welfare: An Invitation, this edition introduces students to the knowledge, skills, and values that are essential for working with individuals, families, groups, organizations, and communities in a variety of practice settings.

Excerpt: The Palace of Versailles ( or; French: ), or simply Versailles, is a royal ch teau in Versailles in the le-de-France region of France. In French it is the Ch teau de Versailles. When the ch teau was built, Versailles was a country village; today, however, it is a suburb of Paris, some twenty kilometres southwest of the French capital. The court of Versailles was the centre of political power in France from 1682, when Louis XIV moved from Paris, until the royal family was forced to return to the capital in October 1789 after the beginning of the French Revolution. Versailles is therefore famous not only as a building, but as a symbol of the system of absolute monarchy of the Ancien R gime. The original hunting lodge in 1623The earliest mention of the name of Versailles is found in a document dated 1038, the Charte de l'abbaye Saint-P re de Chartres (Charter of the Saint-P re de Chartres Abbey) (Gu rard, 1840), in which one of the signatories was a certain Hugo de Versailliis (Hugues de Versailles), who was seigneur of Versailles. During this period, the village of Versailles centred on a small castle and church and the area was governed by a local lord. Its location on the road from Paris to Dreux and Normandy brought some prosperity to the village but, following an outbreak of the Plague and the Hundred Years' War, the village was largely destroyed and its population sharply ...", 'id': '7gxNYgEACAAJ'}, {'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'authors': ['Source: Wikipedia'], 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=xdlRYgEACAAJ&dq=17th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'ISBN_13': '9781155642628', 'ISBN_10': '1155642627', 'pageCount': 48, 'publisher': 'Books LLC, Wiki Series', 'subtitle': 'Sighthound, Greyhound, Azawakh, Afghan Hound, Whippet, Italian Greyhound, Pharaoh Hound, Irish Wolfhound, Ibizan Hound', 'title': 'Sighthounds', 'description': "Please note that the content of this book primarily consists of articles available from Wikipedia or other free sources online.

Excerpt: The Rhodesian Ridgeback is a dog breed developed in Southern Africa where it was used (among other things) to hunt lions. This is most likely why this dog is known for its bravery. Its European forebears can be traced to the early pioneers of the Cape Colony of southern Africa, who crossed their dogs with the semi-domesticated, ridged hunting dogs of the Khoikhoi. In the earlier parts of its history, the Rhodesian Ridgeback has also been known as Van Rooyen's Lion Dogs, the African Lion Hound or African Lion Dog-Simba Inja in Ndebele, Shumba Imbwa in Shona-because of their ability to distract a lion while awaiting their master to make the kill. The original breed standard was drafted by F.R. Barnes, in Bulawayo, Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), in 1922. Based on that of the Dalmatian, the standard was approved by the South African Kennel Union in 1926. This dog is now used to help athletes train. Rhodesian Ridgeback runningThe Khoikhoi people occupied the Cape Peninsula during the mid 17th century when the Dutch began trading with the area and set up a trading station. These people had a dog which was used for hunting; described as ugly, but noted for its ferocity when acting as a guard dog. This dog measured 18 inches (46 cm) at the withers, with a lean but muscular frame. The ears have been described both as erect and hanging, but the most distinct feature was the length of hair growing in...", 'id': 'xdlRYgEACAAJ'}, {'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'authors': ['General Books LLC'], 'pageCount': 38, 'ISBN_13': '9781158124343', 'ISBN_10': '1158124341', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=HoywSgAACAAJ&dq=17th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'subtitle': 'States and Territories Established in the 17th Century Bc, Babylonia, Hittite Empire', 'title': '17th-Century Bc Establishments', 'id': 'HoywSgAACAAJ'}, {'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'authors': ['General Books LLC'], 'pageCount': 50, 'ISBN_13': '9781158159253', 'ISBN_10': '1158159250', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=04qjSgAACAAJ&dq=17th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'subtitle': '17th-Century Ottoman Sultans, Osman Ii, Murad Iv, Ahmed I, Mustafa I, Mehmed Iii, Mustafa Ii, Ahmed Ii', 'title': '17th-Century Monarchs in Europe', 'id': '04qjSgAACAAJ'}, {'categories': ['Social Science'], 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=ND9-uAAACAAJ&dq=17th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'publisher': 'Hephaestus Books', 'subtitle': 'Abel Tasman, Evliya Ã!elebi, Samuel de Champlain, Henry Hudson, Robert Bylot, William Baffin, John Smit', 'title': 'Articles on 17th-Century Explorers, Including', 'description': 'Please note that the content of this book primarily consists of articles available from Wikipedia or other free sources online.

Excerpt: New Netherland, or Nieuw-Nederland in Dutch, was the 17th-century colonial province of the Republic of the Seven United Netherlands on the East Coast of North America. The claimed territories were the lands from the Delmarva Peninsula to extreme southwestern Cape Cod. The settled areas are now part of the Mid-Atlantic States of New York, New Jersey, Delaware, and Connecticut, with small outposts in Pennsylvania and Rhode Island. The provincial capital, New Amsterdam, was located at the southern tip of the island of Manhattan on upper New York Bay. The colony was conceived as a private business venture to exploit the North American fur trade. New Netherland was slowly settled during its first decades, partially as a result of policy mismanagement by the Dutch West India Company (WIC), and conflicts with Native Americans. The settlements of New Sweden developed on its southern flank and its northern border was re-drawn in recognition of early New England expansion. During the 1650s, the colony experienced dramatic growth and became a major port for trade in the North Atlantic. The surrender of Fort Amsterdam to English control in 1664 was formalized in 1667, contributing to the Second Anglo-Dutch War. In 1673 the Dutch re-took the area, but later relinquished it under the 1674 Treaty of Westminster ending the Third Anglo-Dutch War. The inhabitants of New Netherland were Native Americans, Europeans, and Africans, the latter chiefly imported as enslaved laborers.

Excerpt: El Greco (1541 - April 7, 1614) was a painter, sculptor, and architect of the Spanish Renaissance. "El Greco" (The Greek) was a nickname, a reference to his Greek origin, and the artist normally signed his paintings with his full birth name in Greek letters, (Dom nikos Theotok poulos). El Greco was born in Crete, which was at that time part of the Republic of Venice, and the centre of Post-Byzantine art. He trained and became a master within that tradition before travelling at age 26 to Venice, as other Greek artists had done. In 1570 he moved to Rome, where he opened a workshop and executed a series of works. During his stay in Italy, El Greco enriched his style with elements of Mannerism and of the Venetian Renaissance. In 1577, he moved to Toledo, Spain, where he lived and worked until his death. In Toledo, El Greco received several major commissions and produced his best known paintings.

But how were time and space conceived before modernity? When did this begin to change in Europe? To help answer such questions, this volume looks at the exchange of information and the development of communications networks at the dawn of journalism, when widespread public and private networks first emerged for the transmission of political news. The collection offers the first panoramic view of the way stories were born, grew and matured during their transmission from source to source, from country to country.

His long hair trailed down his well-muscled neck in a satisfying weighty mass. Wiping his eyes and completely relaxed, Hideo looked first at the swords on the stand nearest him and then fell into a reverie. His earliest childhood memory was not of his beloved mother but of his father’s swords. The ritual was invariable. Before his father would kiss his mother, before his father would greet or dandle him, the man who had had the courage and audacity to marry the daughter of one of the Dictator Oda’s concubines removed his sandals with great care and walked to the black lacquer, double sword stand and, employing ever greater care, first removed the long sword from his sash and then the shorter sword. Each was positioned with incredible accuracy so that the handle and guard were outside of the cradle formed by the arms of the stand. The long sword was always placed above the shorter one. Their graceful curves, shining black lacquer scabbards, and silk-wrapped grips fascinated Hideo. They were so intimately associated with his father—a kindly but serious man of few words. Shogun Iemitsu chronicles a day in the life of two young samurai, Hideo and Kobiyashi, as they attend a festival, fall in love, and put down a rebellion against the Tokugawa government that changes their lives forever. Shogun Iemitsu is based entirely on historical events, and it is filled with breathtaking details of life under the Shoguns. A must-read for anyone who enjoyed James Clavell's Shogun.

Century-long periods of population expansion come before long periods of stagnation and decline; the dynamics of prices mirror population oscillations; and states go through strong expansionist phases followed by periods of state failure, endemic sociopolitical instability, and territorial loss. Peter Turchin and Sergey Nefedov explore the dynamics and causal connections between such demographic, economic, and political variables in agrarian societies and offer detailed explanations for these long-term oscillations--what the authors call secular cycles. Secular Cycles elaborates and expands upon the demographic-structural theory first advanced by Jack Goldstone, which provides an explanation of long-term oscillations. This book tests that theory's specific and quantitative predictions by tracing the dynamics of population numbers, prices and real wages, elite numbers and incomes, state finances, and sociopolitical instability. Turchin and Nefedov study societies in England, France, and Russia during the medieval and early modern periods, and look back at the Roman Republic and Empire. Incorporating theoretical and quantitative history, the authors examine a specific model of historical change and, more generally, investigate the utility of the dynamical systems approach in historical applications. An indispensable and groundbreaking resource for a wide variety of social scientists, Secular Cycles will interest practitioners of economic history, historical sociology, complexity studies, and demography.", 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9781400830688', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1VzvRDT1W_sC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1VzvRDT1W_sC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '1400830680', 'pageCount': 360, 'authors': ['Peter Turchin', 'Sergey A.

Excerpt: The Treaty of Madrid (also known as the Godolphin Treaty ) adopted in 1670 was a treaty between England and Spain . Under the terms of the treaty, Spain recognized English possessions in the Caribbean Sea: "all those lands, islands, colonies and places whatsoever situated in the West Indies ." England took formal control of Jamaica and the Cayman Islands after the treaty was signed. Spain also agreed to permit English ships freedom of movement in the Caribbean. Each country agreed to refrain from trading in the other\'s territory.See also (online edition) Referenc...', 'id': 'ChFDbwAACAAJ'}, {'categories': ['Law'], 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=L_7bBAAAQBAJ&dq=17th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'publisher': 'Bloomsbury Publishing', 'title': 'Property Rights and Natural Resources', 'description': 'Winner of the SLS Peter Birks Prize for Outstanding Legal Scholarship 2009. The use of private property rights to regulate natural resources is a controversial topic because it touches upon two critical issues: the allocation of wealth in society and the conservation and management of limited resources. This book explores the extension of private property rights and market mechanisms to natural resources in international areas from a legal perspective. It uses marine fisheries to illustrate the issues that can arise in the design of regulatory regimes for natural resources. If property rights are used to regulate natural resources then it is essential that we understand how the law and values embedded within legal systems shape the development and operation of property rights in practice. The author constructs a version of property that articulates both the private and public function of property. This restores some much needed balance to property discourse. He also assesses the impact of international law on the use of property rights-a much neglected topic-and shows how different legal and socio-political values that inhere in different legal regimes fundamentally shape the construction of property rights. Despite the many claimed benefits to be had from the use of private property rights-based management systems, the author warns against an uncritical acceptance of this approach and, in particular, questions whether private property rights are the most suitable and effective arrangement of regulating of natural resources. He suggests that much more complex forms of holding, such as stewardship, may be required to meet physical, legal and moral imperatives associated with natural resources.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9781847315038', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=L_7bBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=L_7bBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '1847315038', 'pageCount': 472, 'authors': ['Richard Barnes'], 'id': 'L_7bBAAAQBAJ'}, {'categories': ['History'], 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=u8MoUGvajLsC&dq=17th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'publisher': 'Arcadia Publishing', 'title': 'James City County', 'description': 'Beyond museum restorations at Jamestown and neighboring Williamsburg, the history of America\'s first county is largely unknown to many who visit or live nearby. However, they see and read a multitude of street, neighborhood, and business names that bear silent witness to the county\'s history. Founded in 1634 atop ancient Algonquin Indian territory, the locality was first made up of plantations and small farms occupied by Europeans and Africans. As they spread out from "James Citie," immigrants sited themselves near rivers and creeks. Waterways provided the earliest transportation network, but interior road maintenance was key to further development of commerce and community. After the Civil War, James City County\'s population was concentrated along the Toano-Norge-Lightfoot corridor. Communities blossomed along an ancient footpath that followed the Virginia Peninsula\'s spine. In the 1880s, the railroad paralleled a portion of it, and motorcars followed, making Richmond Road the county\'s primary thoroughfare.

Flight from Famine is the moving account of a Victorian-era tragedy that has echoes in our own time but seems hardly credible in the light of Ireland’s modern prosperity. The famine survivors who helped build Canada in the years that followed Black ’47 provide a testament to courage, resilience, and perseverance. By the time of Confederation, the Irish population of Canada was second only to the French, and four million Canadians can claim proud Irish descent.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9781770705067', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=M1tVIoSY7IYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=M1tVIoSY7IYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '1770705066', 'pageCount': 368, 'authors': ['Donald MacKay'], 'id': 'M1tVIoSY7IYC'}, {'categories': ['Art'], 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=gdUEAAAAQBAJ&dq=17th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'publisher': 'Cengage Learning', 'title': 'Gardner’s Art through the Ages: Backpack Edition, Book C, Renaissance and Baroque', 'description': 'Gardner’s Art through the Ages: The Western Perspective, 13th Edition is now available in a Backpack Edition comprised of four easy-to-carry paperbacks!

Like many platitudes, it is much less obvious than one might think. Indeed, it has a long and complex history. Jean-Louis Quantin shows how, between the Reformation and the last years of the Restoration, the rationale behind the Church of England's reliance on the Fathers as authorities on doctrinal controversies, changed significantly. Elizabethan divines, exactly like their Reformed counterparts on the Continent, used the Church Fathers to vindicate the Reformation from Roman Catholic charges of novelty, but firmly rejected the authority of tradition. They stressed that, on all questions controverted, there was simply no consensus of the Fathers. Beginning with the 'avant-garde conformists' of early Stuart England, the reference to antiquity became more and more prominent in the construction of a new confessional identity, in contradistinction both to Rome and to Continental Protestants, which, by 1680, may fairly be called 'Anglican'. English divines now gave to patristics the very highest of missions. In that late age of Christianity - so the idea ran - now that charisms had been withdrawn and miracles had ceased, the exploration of ancient texts was the only reliable route to truth. As the identity of the Church of England was thus redefined, its past was reinvented. This appeal to the Fathers boosted the self-confidence of the English clergy and helped them to surmount the crises of the 1650s and 1680s. But it also undermined the orthodoxy that it was supposed to support.", 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9780191565342', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=QwNmY0UFfakC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=QwNmY0UFfakC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '0191565342', 'pageCount': 528, 'authors': ['Jean-Louis Quantin'], 'id': 'QwNmY0UFfakC'}, {'categories': ['Philosophy'], 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=D68Za-c-GXAC&dq=17th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'publisher': 'Walter de Gruyter', 'subtitle': 'Epistemic Expressions in 16th and 17th Century English', 'title': 'The Reign of Truth and Faith', 'description': 'The book explores the semantics and pragmatics of epistemic expressions in 16th and 17th century English: verily, in faith, I ween and others.

Although his empire controlled all of Mesopotamia at the time of his death, his successors were unable to maintain his empire.

In the 1850s, a group of settlers established a community at Waipu in the northern part of New Zealand. They were led there by a stern preacher, Norman McLeod. The community had followed him from Scotland in 1817 to found a settlement in Nova Scotia, then subsequently to New Zealand via Australia. Their incredible journeys actually happened, and in this winner of the New Zealand Book Awards, Fiona Kidman breathes life and contemporary relevance into the facts by creating a remarkable fictional story of three women entangled in the migrations - Isabella, her daughter Annie and granddaughter Maria. McLeod's harsh leadership meant that anyone who ran counter to him had to live a life of secrets. The 'secrets' encapsulated the spirit of these women in their varied reactions to McLeod's strict edicts and connect the past to the present and future.", 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9781426203978', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_ewuxIdF47AC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_ewuxIdF47AC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '1426203977', 'pageCount': 271, 'authors': ['Phil MacDonald', 'Rory Boland'], 'id': '_ewuxIdF47AC'}, {'categories': ['Electronic books'], 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=QjzYdCxumFcC&dq=17th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'averageRating': 5.0, 'publisher': 'Infobase Publishing', 'title': 'Encyclopedia of the Ottoman Empire', 'description': 'Presents a comprehensive A-to-Z reference to the empire that once encompassed large parts of the modern-day Middle East, North Africa, and southeastern Europe.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9781438110257', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=QjzYdCxumFcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=QjzYdCxumFcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '1438110251', 'pageCount': 689, 'authors': ['Ga ́bor A ́goston', 'Bruce Alan Masters'], 'id': 'QjzYdCxumFcC'}, {'categories': ['Putley (England)'], 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=qXomeERzpAEC&dq=17th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'publisher': 'A Herefordshire Village', 'subtitle': 'Putley, 1685 Until Now (the People, Their Lives, the Farming, the Buildings)', 'title': 'Three Centuries of a Herefordshire Village', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9780956445506', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=qXomeERzpAEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=qXomeERzpAEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '0956445500', 'pageCount': 248, 'authors': ['Jean I.

To maintain their power, Afrikaners drew on Christian scripture and traditions to create self-justifying religious narratives that supported their oppressive ideologies, prohibiting inclusion and suppressing pluralism. In time these Afrikaner-Christian narratives began to unravel as counter-narratives within the Christian tradition influenced the Black church to demand equality and democracy. This socio-political and cultural transformation is best understood and interpreted through the vision of ubuntu: a mode of thought in African culture that places a value on humanity in community and shifts the focus from singularity to plurality in South African society. In The Ubuntu God, Samuel A. Paul traces how the dismantling of apartheid led to recognition of the religious other, the recovery of alternate narratives, and the reappearance of ubuntu perspective and practice in the political and public sphere. After the peaceful transition to a democratically elected government, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission created a platform for multiple voices, stories, and religious narratives to be shared in a public political context. This multiplicity of voices resulted, ultimately, in the formation of a new constitution for South Africa that sought to uphold African values of community and inclusion in its institutions. While South Africa's apartheid system and the Truth and Reconciliation Commission are both rooted in the biblical narrative, the former used its theology to enforce an iron rule while the latter combined Christian and African concepts to create a pluralistic and open society. Such a society is characterized by a culture that emphasizes communality and interdependence.", 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9781630878207', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=vBz1BgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=vBz1BgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '1630878200', 'pageCount': 194, 'authors': ['Samuel A Paul'], 'id': 'vBz1BgAAQBAJ'}, {'categories': ['Social Science'], 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=SN53oTMjAyMC&dq=17th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'publisher': 'BRILL', 'subtitle': 'Sino-Mauritian Settlement and Economic Consolidation', 'title': 'Abacus and Mah Jong', 'description': 'This work aims to engage with the complexities surrounding evaluations of ethnic and national identity - a focus of recent interest by scholars from a range of disciplines including political science, anthropology and economics - through a case study of Chinese migration to and settlement in Mauritius.

Not only was the relationship between native inhabitants and colonial settlers a defining characteristic of Acadia/Nova Scotia and New England in this era, but it was also a relationship shaped by wider continental and oceanic connections. The essays in this volume deal with topics such as colonial habitation, imperial exchange, and aboriginal engagement, all of which were pervasive phenomena of the time. John G. Reid argues that these were complicated processes that interacted freely with one another, shaping the human experience at different times and places. Northeastern North America was an arena of distinctive complexities in the early modern period, and this collection uses it as an example of a manageable and logical basis for historical study. Reid also explores the significance of anniversary observances and commemorations that have served as vehicles of reflection on the lasting implications of historical developments in the early modern period. These and other insights amount to a fresh perspective on the region and offer a deeper understanding of North American history.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9781442691261', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=-hNKavYkuXQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=-hNKavYkuXQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '1442691263', 'pageCount': 272, 'authors': ['John G.

The presence of many giant exoplanets in the close vicinity of their star shows that these newly discovered planetary systems are very different from the solar system. New theoretical models are being developed in order to understand their formation scenarios, and new observational methods are being implemented to increase the sensitivity of exoplanet detections. In the present book, the authors address the question of planetary systems from all aspects. Starting from the facts (the detection of more than 300 extraterrestrial planets), they first describe the various methods used for these discoveries and propose a synthetic analysis of their global properties. They then consider the observations of young stars and circumstellar disks and address the case of the solar system as a specific example, different from the newly discovered systems. Then the study of planetary systems and of exoplanets is presented from a more theoretical point of view. The book ends with an outlook to future astronomical projects, and a description of the search for life on exoplanets.

We used our present-day understanding of cells to ‘define’ the living state, providing a basis for exploring several general-interest topics: the origin of life, extraterrestrial life, intelligence, and the possibility that humans are unique. The ideas we proposed in About Life were intended as starting-points for debate – we did not claim them as ‘truth’ – but the information on which they were based is currently accepted as ‘scientific fact’. What does that mean? What is ‘scientific fact’ and why is it accepted? What is science – and is biology like other sciences such as physics (except in subject m- ter)? The book you are now reading investigates these questions – and some related ones. Like About Life, it may particularly interest a reader who wishes to change career to biology and its related subdisciplines. In line with a recommendation by the British Association for the Advancement of Science – that the public should be given fuller information about the nature of science – we present the concepts underpinning biology and a survey of its historical and philosophical basis.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9781402088667', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Gm4bqeBMR8cC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Gm4bqeBMR8cC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '1402088663', 'pageCount': 267, 'authors': ['Paul S.

ConceptualStructuresaremotivated byC.S. Peirce'sExistentialGraphsand were popularized by J.F. Sowa in the 1980s. Over 16 years ICCS has increased its scope to include innovations from a range of theories and related Conceptual Structure practices, among them formal concept analysis and ontologies. The- fore, ICCS presents a family of Conceptual Structure approaches that build on techniques derived from arti?cial intelligence, knowledge representation, applied mathematics and lattice theory, computational linguistics, conceptual modeling, intelligent systems and knowledge management. This volume's title –Knowledge Visualization and Reasoning – is intended to highlight the shared origins of Conceptual Structures with other visual forms of reasoning. J. Howse's invited survey paper “Diagrammatic Reasoning Systems” sets the scene for this theme, and severalother papers in the volume extend and reinforce these connections.

The Society for Creative Anachronism (SCA) is an international living history group with the aim of studying and recreating mainly Medieval European cultures and their histories before the 17th century. A quip often used within the SCA describes it as a group devoted to the Middle Ages "as they ought to have been," choosing to "selectively recreate the culture, choosing elements of the culture that interest and attract us." Founded in 1966, the society had about 32,000 members as of 2008. The SCA\'s roots can be traced to a backyard graduation party of a UC Berkeley medieval studies graduate, ...', 'id': '2W-TSQAACAAJ'}, {'categories': ['Business & Economics'], 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=AOxlKPGhRwYC&dq=17th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'averageRating': 5.0, 'publisher': 'Les Editions de la MSH', 'title': 'Armenians in Asian Trade in the Early Modern Era', 'description': "La poussée de la navigation occidentale au-delà du cap de Bonne Espérance et l'activité connue des diverses compagnies des Indes sont les références habituelles auxquelles renvoie le commerce de l'Asie entre le XVIe et le XVIIIe siècle. Les Européens ont pourtant rencontré sur les routes de l'Asie, maritimes ou continentales, des communautés marchandes bien établies qui, au gré des circonstances et avant la colonisation, ont été aussi bien leurs concurrents que leurs partenaires. Les Arméniens, déjà présents en Europe, sont l'une d'elles; le principal réseau commercial qui les représente à partir du XVIIe siècle est celui de la Nouvelle-Djoulfa, un faubourg arménien fondé près d'Isfahan après la déportation de l'Arménie du Centre-Est par le chah de Perse Abbas Ier en 1604-1605. En se déployant d'Amsterdam au Bengale et au Tibet, et jusqu'aux îles Philippines, en prenant appui sur toute une série de ports et d'étapes répartis des rives de la Baltique ou de la Méditerranée à celles de l'océan Indien ou de la mer de Chine, le réseau commercial formé par les Arméniens de la Nouvelle-Djoulfa a de quoi susciter la curiosité, sinon la passion de l'historien. Il n'a pas manqué de surprendre aussi les contemporains: de la Nouvelle-Djoulfa, dont il découvre le faste grandissant, le chevalier de Chardin dira qu'il est peut-être le plus gros bourg du monde; Gabriel de Chinon y verra, lui, une petite république. Pourvoyeurs d'épices, de tissus, de soie, des produits les plus variés des Indes ou de l'Europe, les marchands arméniens sont aussi les financiers du chah de Perse, les ambassadeurs de l'empereur d'Éthiopie; ils deviennent armateurs dans l'océan Indien, maîtrisent les techniques comptables et commerciales en usage en Orient ou en Occident, négocient avec les souverains ou les compagnies. Ils tentent également, alors que se construit le monde moderne, d'y faire une place à leur nation, à la fois ancrée dans un pays partagé et déterritorialisée. Dans la lignée de quelques travaux pionniers, ce livre réintègre dans le champ de l'histoire un long moment du commerce intercontinental, significatif non seulement des cheminements du capitalisme, mais d'une étonnante aspiration à mettre les nations sur le rang des Etats", 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9782735113668', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=AOxlKPGhRwYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=AOxlKPGhRwYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '2735113663', 'pageCount': 418, 'authors': ['Sushil Chaudhury'], 'id': 'AOxlKPGhRwYC'}, {'categories': ['History'], 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=R85NBAAAQBAJ&dq=17th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'averageRating': 4.0, 'publisher': 'Verso Books', 'subtitle': 'From the Stone Age to the New Millennium', 'title': "A People's History of the World", 'description': 'Chris Harman describes the shape and course of human history as a narrative of ordinary people forming and re-forming complex societies in pursuit of common human goals.

It carefully documents the often fascinating lives of both ordinary and extra-ordinary ancestors. The scope and extent of newly discovered forbearers is breathtaking. Beside an exhaustive Bibliography and Name Index, it also includes a new chapter on genetic origins. The first four chapters explore family roots over a wide swath of Europe and the Middle East. The time horizon of this family's story spans a breathtaking three and a half millennia, back to about 1525 BCE when a man named Cenna and a woman named Neferu, both in ancient Egypt, married. They would become the parents of Queen Tetisheri and the grandparents of Pharoah Sequenenre Tao II, the 5th Pharaoh of the 17th Dynasty of Ancient Egypt. Through the intervening 128 generations the reader meets people leading both ordinary and extra ordinary lives: From farmers, tradesmen, poets, and professionals to one of the murderers of Bishop Beckett and seven Christian saints; from slaves to Kings and Emperors. Most were Christian, but many were Jewish, some Zoroastrian and still others sun worshipers - a few were probably Druids. The final chapter sketches the genetic context of the family history. This sketch runs from the Rift Valley of Africa at about 50,000 years ago to Southern Europe about 20,000 years ago. The earliest individuals in these lines, known only as Mitochondrial Eve and Eurasian-Adam, serve to place this family in the vast context of our evolving species.", 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9781466981034', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=eyeJAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=eyeJAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '1466981032', 'pageCount': 624, 'authors': ['J.

By describing the socio-political context in which this law was one small aspect of a much broader and somewhat fragmented endeavor to assert 'order' and to establish authority, I argue that it would be a mistake to emphasize its prohibitive message over and above its productive and often contradictory effects. Drawing from Haskins insights on 17th century English legal tactics, and Roberts-Millers (1999) analysis of Puritan logic and language use, I warn against reading Puritan rhetoric or legal discourse literally, or ignoring the ways in which a complex system of regulatory controls and discursive slippages interacts to produce unexpected effects.

The pigments identified were lead white, calcium carbonate white, red and yellow iron oxides, umbers, carbon black, Prussian blue, red and yellow lakes, as well as van Dyke brown. Several generations of dammar resin varnish, with a final coat of cellulose containing varnish were detected as well.

Claiming the authority of first-hand observation, they paradoxically rely for their legitimization on the tropes of an established literary tradition. The status of these texts remained ambiguous, not least because of their anecdotal depictions of great riches, brutality or sexual promise. Drawing on the insights of post-colonial scholarship, this study tackles a question given scant attention in previous work and suggests that beyond the hazy representation of the Orient, an opposition emerges between the threatening Near East and the indolent East Indies. Distinguishing recognizable representations from those generated by new encounters, this book questions the feasibility of cultural representation through travel, exploring a large corpus of original sources written by French ecclesiastics, gentlemen-travellers, ambassadors and adventurers. Linguistic, religious, cultural or geographical barriers meant most travellers remained distanced from the peoples about whom they would simultaneously become authoritative. The encounter was further transformed in narratives that were intended to entertain and to satisfy the criterion ofcuriosité.

In exploring the role art plays in shaping an instructional system, the volume's contributors examine literary genres that are both established (comedies, tragedies, sonnets) and nascent (novels, manuals, gazettes) as well as the works of a diverse group of seventeenth-century writers: Chassignet, Subligny, Scarron, Lafayette, La Bruyère, Maintenon, de Visé, Boursault, Molière and Racine. What emerges from this diversity is an invaluable exploration of how educational imperatives, no matter their focus, rely as much on manipulating artistic forms as they do on articulating didactic principles. Broad in its scope while remaining thematically coherent, The Art of Instruction will be of interest to students and scholars of early modern French literature, history, culture and pedagogy.", 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9789042023352', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=0EPwdMRN-LAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=0EPwdMRN-LAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '904202335X', 'pageCount': 300, 'authors': ['Anne Lynn Birberick'], 'id': '0EPwdMRN-LAC'}, {'categories': ['History'], 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=SyogLC4SdRsC&dq=17th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'publisher': 'Central European University Press', 'title': "Kalmykia in Russia's Past and Present National Policies and Administrative System", 'description': '"A detailed history of relations between the Russian state and the Kalmyk people from the 17th century until our days, this book focuses on the Kalmyks\' official accession to the Russian state; the gradual curtailment of the autonomy of the Kalmyk khanate and inclusion of its people in the centralized system of Russian state control; Kalmyk disillusionment as their internal affairs were increasingly encroached upon by the central authorities and the economic burdens imposed on them by their new "patron" kept growing; the tragic story of a part of the people setting off for their ancestral homeland, Dzungaria, in the mid-18th century, with most perishing on the way, never to reach their destination."

The only factor that consistently causes growth, he shows, is centralized support for manufacturing, which spurs the creation of new technologies, which lead to wealth creation. Since the earliest of times, human beings have endeavored to uncover the causes of prosperity. Step by step, Sabillon tests the principal theories on the causes of economic growth against the facts of history. Here, economic statistics of the world are presented in a rationalized format that allows for comparison across countries and through time, with a challenge to those who study them to determine, with an open mind, what the statistics show and what are the trends -- beyond cherished theories that suit various political purposes. Tested against the historical data, textbook ideas and theories consistently come up short. Such analyses are highly troubling because they reveal an absence of correlation between theory and reality. The data, statistics illustrating the development of the world economy during the last several centuries, were extracted from economic, history and economic history books, from publications of the World Bank, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the International Monetary Fund, the World Trade Organization, the United Nations specialized agencies, research institutes and country statistical publications, and other books and journals. Analyzing the data over geography and time, Sabillon concludes that contrary to contemporary wisdom, left to market forces alone the economy will not and does not flourish. Only decisive intervention in support of manufacturing and technological advancement can provide growth. This systematic review of history and test of accepted dogma challenges economic theorists to consider one part of the equation of economic policy that has been wiped off the blackboard in today s politically-correct debates.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9780875865904', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=HHdmojqrQT4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=HHdmojqrQT4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '0875865909', 'pageCount': 340, 'authors': ['Carlos Sabillon'], 'id': 'HHdmojqrQT4C'}, {'categories': ['Education'], 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=rYW8tKzrFd4C&dq=17th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'publisher': 'Nova Publishers', 'title': 'Science Education in the 21st Century', 'description': "This is hardly another field in education which is more important for a country's future than science education.

The seventeenth century is the main object of this study, since it was a formative era. For Ottoman Jews, the 'Ottoman century' constituted an era of gradual acculturation to changing reality, parallel to the changing character of the Ottoman state. Continuous changes and developments shaped anew the character of this Jewry, the core of what would later become known as 'Sephardi Jewry'.Yaron Ben-Naeh draws from primary and secondary Hebrew, Ottoman, and European sources, the image of Jewish society in the Ottoman Empire. In the chapters he leads the reader from the overall urban framework to individual aspects. Beginning with the physical environment, he moves on to discuss their relationships with the majority society, followed by a description and analysis of the congregation, its organization and structure, and from there to the character of Ottoman Jewish society and its nuclear cell - the family. Special emphasis is placed throughout the work on the interaction with Muslim society and the resulting acculturation that affected all aspects and all levels of Jewish life in the Empire. In this, the author challenges the widespread view that sees this community as being stagnant and self-segregated, as well as the accepted concept of a traditional Jewish society under Islam.", 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9783161495236', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=xWZ4qCzJKasC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=xWZ4qCzJKasC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '3161495233', 'pageCount': 503, 'authors': ['Yaron Ben-Naeh'], 'id': 'xWZ4qCzJKasC'}, {'categories': ['History'], 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=U8IiSNvFGngC&dq=17th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'publisher': 'Academica Press,LLC', 'subtitle': 'Environmental History and the Western Worldview', 'title': 'The Decline of Nature', 'description': '“No book could be more timely then The Decline of Nature. LaFreniere offers an in-depth analysis of the fundamental issues that must be faced if solutions for environmental crisis are to be found. His arguments are a refreshing alternative to the superficial policy proposals of politicians and the glib reporting of the mass media. — The Decline of Nature is a masterful critique of the stories that own us. LaFreniere\'s analytical effort is a veritable tour de force.” From the Foreword by Professor Max Oelschlaeger, Northern Arizona University “The virtue of his book is threefold: it ingeniously connects the latest findings of environmental science to the broad stream of cultural history; exposes the flaws inherent in western attitudes about nature, especially the destructive, providential "idea of nature; and revives the much neglected field of speculative philosophy of history” From an appreciation by Professor Klaus Fischer, author of “Oswald Spengler and the Decline of the West” and “Nazi Germany: A New History” “…Sweepingly brilliant!” Dr. J.Donald Hughes Description: This work is a radical rethinking of the key currents of intellectual and environmental history. The Decline of Nature is an account of Western attitudes and behavior toward nature, from the deforestation of Western Europe during the High Middle Ages through the Scientific Revolution and the technological exploitation of nature in the 19th and 20th centuries, and on to the Environmental Movement. The destruction of European and colonial ecosystems parallels the rise of modern mechanistic science and a science-based idea of progress which has been perverted by economic ideologies into a belief in unlimited development of nature-as-resources into the amenities of the consumer society. Ecosystems and species diversity have declined to isolated and shrinking remnants subject to further degradation due to global warming resulting from human intervention in global climate cycles. These massive changes will have a catastrophic effect upon evolutionary processes, mankind and the survival of the Earth. The Decline of Nature is an environmental history of ideas embedded in a compact account of Western civilization\'s ecological impact upon the planet, particularly in Europe and its colonies. The major thesis presented is the idea that two speculative philosophies of history (attempts to understand the meaning of history) and their associated worldviews have been largely responsible for destructive attitudes and behaviors towards nature. They include the idea of providence (i.e. the Christian worldview) and the idea of progress (the science and technology-based vision of unrestrained economic development and material accumulation since the 17th century). Some scholars understand the idea of progress as a secularization of the Christian millennium, the creation of a new Eden through science and technology.A third, alternative philosophy of history, the idea of history as multiple cycles of civilizations rising, flourishing, and declining, was popular in both classical Greco-Roman and ancient Asian civilizations, but was rejected by Western civilization until its revival during the Renaissance and in 19th and 20th century. Oswald Spengler\'s Decline of the West was the founding work of cyclical philosophy of history in the 20th century. Spengler, Arnold Toynbee, and other 20th century speculative philosophers of history have been criticized by postmodern philosophers for creating logically indefensible “grand narratives”. However, Spengler\'s mysterious cycles of civilization have found at least a partial scientific explanation in the new discipline of environmental history. Environmental degradation played a major role in the decline of ancient Mesopotamian, Greco-Roman, Mayan and Asian civilizations. Spengler was also perceptive in distinguishing the nature-destroying tendencies of humanity in general, and Western (Faustian) civilization in particular. This monograph reflects on the position of global societies facing environmental, social and economic destruction and the historical processes that have resulted in this crisis of both man and nature.Market: Environmental History, Environmental Studies, Intellectual History Release Date: 5/25/2008 Copyright: 2008 ISBN/Price: PAPER:1933146-51-6; $44.95 Trim Size: 6 x 9 Pages: 457 Index: Yes Bibliography: Yes Illustrations: Yes CIP: Yes Publisher: Academica Press, LLC Box 60728 Cambridge Station Palo Alto,CA. 94306 Contact: Robert Redfern-West (650)329-0685;academicapress@gmail.com See our website for more information: www.Academic', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9781933146515', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=U8IiSNvFGngC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=U8IiSNvFGngC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '1933146516', 'pageCount': 457, 'authors': ['Gilbert F.

The quality of early object relations is examined in the context of the infant's ability to self-regulate and discharge aggression. The hypothesis is that individuals with anorexia nervosa were unconsciously discouraged from discharging aggressive feelings externally in the relationship with early caregivers, leaving these individuals with an overabundance of internalized rage and hatred in the service of preserving the relied upon object. This dissertation explores the possible benefits of working through a discordant transference while simultaneously fostering regenerative experiences in the transference for individuals with anorexia.

Lewis, discusses the subject of rape in classic and contemporary Hollywood cinema---yesterday and today, i.e., from 1915 to 2003---in which I interrogate the rape and victimization of women as viewed through the lens of feminist theory and film. Despite much feminist intervention and revamping of rape laws, women are still seen as instigators of their own victimization as well as victims of a distraught and failing femininity. I concur with many film theorists that most rape scenes provide insight into the power relations of race, gender and class oppressions; however, by taking a slight departure, I move beyond these relations and enter into a wider discussion of the construction of female virtue, pedophilia, female sexual orientation, woman as spectacle, woman in the middle, and commodification of female sexuality. I also discuss the relationship between rape and religion. Working from a selective rather than exhaustive and from a thematic rather than a strictly historic framework, these themes are discussed in conjunction with their significance as it relates to particularly graphic rape scenes. That is, I explore what these films collectively say about rape, as I try to understand what about the victim or theme makes the rape scene so graphic. I submit that in each of the films that I analyze, the individual trauma of the victim has its etiology in more complex dysfunctions of the larger social world; therefore, I examine sexual victimization in the context of the societal power structure in which she resides. I also look at masculinities under pressure and how these pressures are often used to explain and to excuse men doing harm to women. Finally, I juxtapose the connection between past histories and images of rape in film with the contemporary reality of the discourse of rape and provide some commentary on how to lessen their impact onto the female experience.', 'id': 'E33NhiOGbncC'}, {'categories': ['History'], 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=USiyy1ZA-BsC&dq=17th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'averageRating': 4.5, 'publisher': 'Osprey Publishing', 'subtitle': 'The Complete History', 'title': 'Piracy', 'description': 'When we think of pirates we conjure up images of Blackbeard and Captain Kidd, but these characters hailed from one period.

The 'Domesday Book' of 1086 recorded Greatham as being 'Terra Regis', a Latin term meaning 'Land of the King', indicating that this was once a Royal manor belonging to William the Conqueror himself. In later years, the manor passed through many families by marriage and by purchase, including the Devenish, Marshall, Norton, Freeland, Love, Chawner and Coryton families. The name of the village has changed many times, however slightly, over the years. Greteham, Grietham, Gretham, Grutham, Gratham all derived from two separate words, the 'Old-English' (Anglo-Saxon) 'ham', meaning 'village, estate, manor or homestead' and an old Scandinavian word 'griot' or 'gryt', meaning 'stones or stony ground'. Thus the name 'Greotham' came into being, literally a 'stony estate' or 'farm on gravel'.", 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9780955675317', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=7E-b_ptWV-kC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=7E-b_ptWV-kC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '0955675316', 'pageCount': 200, 'authors': ['Peter Gripton'], 'id': '7E-b_ptWV-kC'}, {'categories': ['Business & Economics'], 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=UdjVAgAAQBAJ&dq=17th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'publisher': 'OECD Publishing', 'title': 'OECD Reviews of Tertiary Education OECD Reviews of Tertiary Education: Poland 2007', 'description': 'In many OECD countries, tertiary education systems have experienced rapid growth over the last decade.

He spent almost all of his adult life in solitude, poverty, and obscurity within the walls of a priory. He was known for profound peace and high commitment to Jesus Christ. He cared not for the worldly status of his tasks, but the motivation behind it. "We can do little things for God," he wrote. "I turn the cake that is frying on the pan for love of him, and that done, if there is nothing else to call me, I prostrate myself in worship before him, who has given me grace to work; afterwards I rise happier than a king. It is enough for me to pick up but a straw from the ground for the love of God." Generations after his death, this book has become one of the most popular Christian books in history. It was oft quoted by John Wesley and A.W. Tozer, and today tens of millions of copies are in circulation. This edition is available on-demand and is printed in its original translated format.

The potential of Jerusalem artichoke as a source for inulin, a fructose polymer that may provide dietary health benefits for obesity, diabetes, and several other health issues and the possible use of the crop for biofuels are drawing tremendous recent interest. With its ready cultivation and minimal pest and disease problems, Jerusalem artichoke is an underutilized resource that possesses the potential to meet major health and energy challenges. A comprehensive, up-to-date reference, Biology and Chemistry of Jerusalem Artichoke presents the unique biological and chemical properties that distinguish it from other crops. Citing a diverse cross-section of references, it reviews the history, classification, morphology, and anatomy of the plant. It details inulin chemistry addressing properties and structure, extraction, and modification using microbes, enzymes, and a wide range of chemical processes. The book examines the use of Jerusalem artichokes as a biofuel and the role of inulin derived from the crop in combating obesity and diabetes, as well as promoting bone, blood, bowel, and immune health. A comprehensive chapter addresses genetic resources, breeding, breeding methods, hybridization, and the heritability of important traits. The book details developmental biology in terms of maximizing yield and determining resource allocation as well as controlling pests and disease. It concludes with practical information on agronomic methods, storage, the economics of crop production, and future prospects for utilization. Gathering a wealth of information into a single volume and drawing on the authors' 25 years of research, Biology and Chemistry of Jerusalem Artichoke provides the most comprehensive resource to date on this extremely useful crop.", 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9781420044966', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=XwZJN1HSajcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=XwZJN1HSajcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '1420044966', 'pageCount': 496, 'authors': ['Stanley J.

Some reflected on their desires in quiet solitude, while others endured verbal, physical, and legal harassment for publicly expressing homosexual interest through words or actions. Long Before Stonewall seeks to uncover the many iterations of same-sex desire in colonial America and the early Republic, as well as to expand the scope of how we define and recognize homosocial behavior. Thomas A. Foster has assembled a pathbreaking, interdisciplinary collection of original and classic essays that explore topics ranging from homoerotic imagery of black men to prison reform to the development of sexual orientations. This collection spans a regional and temporal breadth that stretches from the colonial Southwest to Quaker communities in New England. It also includes a challenge to commonly accepted understandings of the Native American berdache.

For example, the common red poppy is known as "Blind Man" due to an old superstitious belief that if the poppy were put to the eyes it would cause blindness.

For example, Beauty-Berry is the name given to the American shrub that belongs to the genus Callicarpa. Callicarpa is Greek for beautiful fruit. Still other names come from literary sources providing rich detail of the transmission of words through the ages. Conceived as part of the author\'s wider interest in plant and tree lore and ethnobotanical studies, this fully revised edition of Elsevier\'s Dictionary of Plant Names and Their Origins contains over 30,000 vernacular and literary English names of plants.

Almost every column is self-contained and gives the context, significance and some of the details of a particular facet of his work. First we find interesting stories about Euler's work in geometry. In a discussion of the Euler polyhedral formula the author speculates about whether Descartes had a role in Euler's discovery and analyzes the flaw in Euler's proof. We also learn of Euler's solution to Cramer's paradox and its role in the early days of linear algebra. Number theory is well-represented. We see Euler's first proof of Fermat's little theorem for which he used mathematical induction, as well as his discovery of over a hundred pairs of amicable numbers, and his work on odd perfect numbers, about which little is known even today. Elsewhere in the book we learn of the development of what we now call Venn diagrams, what Euler knew about orthogonal matrices, Euler's ideas on the foundations of calculus (before the days of limits, epsilons and deltas), and his proof that mixed partial derivatives are equal.Professor Sandifer based his columns on Euler's own words in the original language in which they were written. In this way, the author was able to uncover many details that are not found in other sources. For example, we see how Euler used differential equations and continued fractions to prove that the constant e is irrational, several years before Lambert, who is usually credited with this discovery. Euler also made an observation equivalent to saying that the number of primes less than a number x is approximately x/Inx, an observation usually attributed to Gauss some 15 years after Euler died.The collection ends with a somewhat playful, but factual, account of Euler's role in the discovery on America.", 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9780883855638', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=sohHs7ExOsYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=sohHs7ExOsYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '0883855631', 'pageCount': 237, 'authors': ['C.

The third in a series of illustrated military history books, following the highly successful Battle and Weapon, Warrior features vivid accounts of daily life, training, and tactics of the ordinary fighting man. There are also features on the kit they carried and the weapons they used, as well as the part they played in significant battles. In addition to celebrated soldiers of Europe and North America there are sections on equally formidable warriors from other parts of the world, such as the Mongol horsemen of the 13th century, the Aztecs, the Samurai of 17th-century Japan, New Zealand's Maori and the Zulus of South Africa. Warrior is organized into six sections, covering six distinct periods in the history of warfare: Phalanxes and Legions deals with the warfare of Ancient Greece and Rome; Conquest and Chivalry explores the age of warriors who fought for either honor or plunder; Pikemen and Musketeers charts the advent of gunpowder in the 16th century; Empires and Frontiers deals with expansion of empires and the clashes of colonization; Trenches and Dogfights looks at the mechanized warfare of World War I and II, when the development of tanks, aeroplanes and submarines as weapons of war marks the beginning of a completely new era; and Guerillas and Commandos shows that despite the proliferation of death-dealing machines the ordinary soldier still retains a role, sometimes highly specialized, such as helicopter-borne infantry, or guerrilla forces like the Vietcong, who managed to resist the most powerful army on earth.", 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9780756644031', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Pgdthq9_opsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Pgdthq9_opsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '0756644038', 'pageCount': 360, 'authors': ['R.G.

He analyses the writings of first-generation New England Puritans, the Royalists in France during the English Civil War, and the 'interior exiles' of John Milton and John Dryden. D'Addario explores the nature of artistic creation from the religious and political margins of early modern England, and in doing so, provides detailed insight into the psychological and material pressures of displacement and a much overdue study of the importance of exile to the development of early modern literature.", 'id': '5aUmKLLAox0C'}, {'categories': ['History'], 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=YRifHNnsiZ4C&dq=17th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'publisher': 'Oxford Archaeological Unit', 'title': 'Excavation of Medieval Pits and a Probable 16th to 17th Century Tavern Or Inn at 7-8 Broad Street, Reading, Berkshire, 2002', 'description': "Excavations at 7-8 Broad Street, revealed part of a possible 16th- to 17th-century tavern or inn, situated behind the street frontage.

In poetry and literature, individual thought and action were prevalent, while depictions of the human form became a touchstone of Renaissance art. In science and medicine the macrocosm and microcosm of the human condition inspired remarkable strides in research and discovery, and the Earth itself was explored, situating Europeans within a wider realm of possibilities.

Both the cloth and the clothing made from it are now considered important constituents of Okinawan identity. The Japanese Folk Craft Movement in the 1930s brought attention to this special trait of Okinawan material culture. After years of decline following World War II, the weaving and use of bashofu saw a revival that accelerated after the return of Okinawa to Japan in 1972 and still continues. Although today bashofu receives considerable attention because of its status since 1974 as one of Japan\'s important intangible cultural properties, its origins and history had remained hidden. In this book Katrien Hendrickx searches for the origins of bashofu in the Ryukyus, including the origins of ito basho, the plant that provides the raw material, and studies the yarn-making methods and weaving techniques. She also focuses on why and how the Ryukyuan people adopted those techniques and introduced them into their own society. By careful analysis of all available sources, considered from viewpoints from fields as various as pure history, phytohistory, philology, ethnography, and folklore, Hendrickx convincingly proves that bashofu was introduced in the Ryukyus from Southern China, and not from Southeast Asia as is commonly argued. Her overview of present-day bashofu-weaving and its use also provides valuable insights into the situation of folk-craft within Okinawan society during the second half of the twentieth century and up to the present day.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9789058676146', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ULyu8dNqS1sC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ULyu8dNqS1sC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '9058676145', 'pageCount': 336, 'authors': ['Katrien Hendrickx'], 'id': 'ULyu8dNqS1sC'}, {'categories': ['Music'], 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=1PgPVnBH3FEC&dq=17th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'publisher': 'Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.', 'subtitle': 'The Villancico and Related Genres', 'title': 'Devotional Music in the Iberian World, 1450-1800', 'description': "From the fifteenth century to the beginning of the nineteenth century, devotional music played a fundamental role in the Iberian world.

Finally, a comparison between &ltI>Corinne and &ltI>Delphine and &ltI>La Duchesse de la Valliere and &ltI>Madame de Maintenon underlines the importance of history for these two writers and the different ways in which they approached it in their work."', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9781433101090', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=JIXsJkC2_i4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=JIXsJkC2_i4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '1433101092', 'pageCount': 127, 'authors': ['Machteld De Poortere'], 'id': 'JIXsJkC2_i4C'}, {'categories': ['Cooking'], 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=S6t4RAAACAAJ&dq=17th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'publisher': 'Greenwood Publishing Group', 'title': 'Invention of the Modern Cookbook', 'description': 'This eye-opening history will change the way you read a cookbook or regard a TV chef, making cooking ventures vastly more interesting—and a lot more fun.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9781598844863', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=S6t4RAAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=S6t4RAAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '1598844865', 'pageCount': 261, 'authors': ['Sandra Sherman'], 'id': 'S6t4RAAACAAJ'}, {'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'authors': ['Mingtao Shi'], 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=8ZRo-lxUDwkC&dq=17th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'ISBN_13': '9783798320574', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8ZRo-lxUDwkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8ZRo-lxUDwkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '3798320578', 'pageCount': 358, 'publisher': 'Univerlagtuberlin', 'subtitle': 'A Comparative Study from the Perspective of the Resource Based View', 'title': 'Technology Base of Mobile Cellular Operators in Germany and China', 'id': '8ZRo-lxUDwkC'}, {'categories': ['Auriesville (N.Y.)'], 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=t3nPbwAACAAJ&dq=17th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'publisher': 'Clear Light Publishing', 'subtitle': 'The Life and Miracles of Kateri Tekakwitha', 'title': 'Kateri, Native American Saint', 'description': 'Kateri, Native American Saint takes the reader into the world of 17th Century Native Americans and Catholic missionaries.

These chronologies when combined with chronologies from the surrounding area were utilized to develop streamflow reconstructions in the Wind River Basin, Wyoming from 1672 AD. Three regression approaches were used to reconstruct streamflow: Stepwise Regression, Principal Components Analysis with Stepwise Regression (PCR), and Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR). Three predictor pools of chronologies were used for each approach. The streamflow reconstructions at Bull Lake Creek above Bull Lake, Little Popo Agie River near Lander, Wyoming, and Wind River near Dubois, Wyoming gage stations explained 40%--64% of the variance, when compared to the instrumental record, using Stepwise Regression. The results reveal several periods of extreme wet and dry periods. While the 20th century displayed both extremes, several of the wettest periods in the past three centuries appear in the 1900s.

Excerpt: A galley is a ship that is propelled by human oarsmen, used for trade and warfare. Galleys dominated naval warfare in the Mediterranean Sea from the 8th century BC to the development of effective naval gunnery in the 16th century. Galleys fought in the wars of Assyria, ancient Phoenicia, Greece, Carthage and Rome until the 4th century. After the fall of the Roman Empire galleys formed the mainstay of the Byzantine navy and other navies of successors of the Roman Empire, as well as new Muslim navies. Medieval Mediterranean states, notably the Italian maritime republics, including Venice, Pisa, and Genoa, used galleys until the ocean-going man-of-war made them obsolete. The Battle of Lepanto was one of the largest naval battles in which galleys played the principal part. Galleys were in common use until the introduction of broadside sailing ships of war into the Mediterranean in the 17th Century, but continued to be applied minor roles until steam propulsion. The modern term "galley" derives from the medieval Greek galea, originally an oared vessel similar to the Byzantine dromon, though smaller and with only one row of oars. The origin of the Greek word is unclear but could possibly be related to, galeos, "dog-fish; small shark." It has been attested in English from c. 1300 and present in most European languages from around 1500 as a general term for oared war vessels, especially contemporary types used in ...', 'id': 'UMRJbwAACAAJ'}, {'categories': ['Travel'], 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=eFVjMocptcYC&dq=17th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'averageRating': 4.0, 'publisher': 'Bradt Travel Guides', 'subtitle': 'The Bradt Travel Guide', 'title': 'Serbia', 'description': 'The ex-Yugoslav region of Serbia is experiencing a re-launch of tourism that has opened up the country.

Excerpt: Basque bowls (Basque: ), is one of the few Basque rural sports which do not originate in an activity related to rural or marine work. It has a number of other names too and is played in a bolatoki or bolaleku "bowls place" which often consists of a playing area in the open, an open sided structure with a low roof or a playing area located inside a colonnaded hallway. The game has been more common in the southern parts of the Basque Country in the last few centuries, especially in lava and Biscay and to a lesser degree in Gipuzkoa and Navarre but documents from the Bayonne archives from the 17th-century mention the games and there is also other evidence to show that the game was also played historically in the northern part of the Basque Country. The main characteristic of the Basque variants of the game is the more prominent use of balls with finger-holes and hand-holes which distinguishes it from other regions in the area which prefer balls without. They are all variants of dirt-track and lawn bowls and as such related to games such as bowls, skittles and bowling. There is a large number of different variations of the game (over 25 variants in Biscay and lava alone), sometimes sharing their rules with varieties in other areas like Cantabria, Burgos or Le n. Some varieties are extremely localised and with specialised playing areas not found outside the area.

From this, we can conclude that not only the role of the press is a much discussed and disputed topic today but that it was also in the past. It gives us also a hint that “lessons” of media history are essential in order to get an understanding of its structures, content, and influence. Present-day media arrangements are not natural and unavoidable. A study of media history makes us also aware of alternatives, i.e., how media could have been or can be arranged. In this essay, I will portray the history of the newspaper development from the 17th century until the 21st century. My aim is to point up how the structures, methods of news gathering and diffusion via the mass medium newspaper have evolved by giving a brief overview over the important stages in the development process. Since this medium boasts such a vivid history, and, as mentioned before, media history is an important chapter to learn about, I want to focus upon the earlier periods of newspaper publishing. Constraints of space do not allow to elaborate on the current debates about media issues.

In recent decades, as a result of a renewed attention to the institutional, political, social, and cultural context of scienti?c activity, we have witnessed a reappraisal of the role of the universities in the construction and development of early modern science.

Faced with the scientific and economic challenges of the 21st century, however, it\'s time to revisit our traditional understanding of our Christian heritage. St. Augustine\'s monumental work, "The City of God," built on his original sin interpretation of the Garden of Eden story, traditionally defined the role of the responsible individual living within the resulting, orthodox structure. But what is the role of such an individual living in an era that has witnessed the waning of the power and influence of that institutional authority-the authority built on Augustine\'s persuasive interpretation of the events described in the Garden of Eden story? Without throwing the baby out with the bath water, and by paying homage to Augustinian sacrifice and commitment to belief, Eden and the Individual: Christianity for the 21st Century explores that question. In the process it offers creative conclusions directed toward enhancing the meaning, and value, of individual lives. Given a fresh sense of purpose, every individual can then work toward creating, and preserving, the order and structure that have governed collective Western life.

They address questions raised by the recurrent observation that, all too frequently, the present ways and means of teaching mathematics generate in the student a lasting aversion against numbers, rather than an understanding of the useful and sometimes enchanting things one can do with them. Parents, teachers, and researchers in the field of education are well aware of this dismal situation, but their views about what causes the wide-spread failure and what steps should be taken to correct it have so far not come anywhere near a practicable consensus. The authors of the chapters in this book have all had extensive experience in teaching as well as in educational research. They approach the problems they have isolated from their own individual perspectives. Yet, they share both an overall goal and a specific fundamental conviction that characterized the efforts about which they write here. The common goal is to find a better way to teach mathematics. The common conviction is that knowledge cannot simply be transferred ready-made from parent to child or from teacher to student but has to be actively built up by each learner in his or her own mind.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9780306472015', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=PmgQBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=PmgQBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '0306472015', 'pageCount': 250, 'authors': ['E. von Glasersfeld'], 'id': 'PmgQBwAAQBAJ'}, {'categories': ['History'], 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=9E1BQ7PVXKIC&dq=17th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'averageRating': 3.5, 'publisher': 'Penguin', 'subtitle': 'The Biography of a City', 'title': 'Paris', 'description': 'A history of the "city of lights" profiles it as one of the world\'s most culturally significant locales, in an accessible volume that covers such events as Paris\'s settlement at the end of the Stone Age, its role in numerous social and political revolutions, its survival of the Middle Age plague, and the cultural and architectural achievements of the Impressionist era.

By the 1600s, samurai were also expected to become versed in aesthetics, calligraphy, philosophical matters and writing poetry. SABURO-The Saga of a Teenage Samurai are true-to-life stories of a young boy who opts to become a roving shugyosha (shuu-g\'yoh-shah), or "samurai in training," rather than serve a feudal lord, leading him to extraordinary adventures that bring out the culture of his times. Saburo was born in the mid-1600s when the country was ruled by the illustrious Tokugawa line of shoguns who had closed the country off to foreigners except for a tiny detachment of traders in Nagasaki-and had turned their backs on Western guns in favor of the traditional sword. Each story is filled with cultural and historical facts that reveal both negative and positive elements in the lives of the samurai class, with Saburo surmounting those that are negative and eventually finding a master who explains the essence and the purpose of life.

In one of its most commonly accepted meanings, Baroque describes some aspects of 17th century art, with sumptuous Roma at the centre, that upset the proportions and static harmony of the Renaissance - already undermined by Mannerism during the previous century - through the use of curves, strange movements of forms, the daring optics of illusionism and theatricality. Bernini, Borromini, da Cortona and Rubens were, among others decisive examples. In addition to these manifestly theatrical expressions, however, the art of the 17th century also included quite different trends such as the naturalism in the works of Caravaggio, classicism in the works of the Carraccis and of Poussin, the intimacy of Vermeer and the pictorial atmospheres in the works of Rembrandt and Velazquez. A reflection of the social , political, scientific, cultural and religious events that profoundly churned European society, the Baroque illuminated Spain, France, the Netherlands and other areas of Europe, and even the rest of the world,, with new splendor, from the time of its birth in Italy where it was sponsored by the Church and powerful families. At the same time, the emergence of new patrons and collectors meant that it followed new traces encountering music, literature and theatre. At the beginning of the 18th century, following the mature evolution of Baroque art, the Rococo was born in France - and then expanded o the rest of Europe - characterized by airy forms, arabesques, elegance and luminous colours in painting as well as sculpture and architecture; instead of heroic or sacred themes, it embodied a more light-hearted glance at aristocratic life, or scenes of daily life that might be gay or frivolous or even quiet. Watteau, Fragonard, Boucher, Canaletto and Bellotto were representatives of this style in painting while, in architecture, Neumann and the magnificent Residenz in Wurzburg are particularly worthy of note.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9788881178094', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=08nhSAAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=08nhSAAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '8881178095', 'pageCount': 319, 'authors': ['Scala Group'], 'id': '08nhSAAACAAJ'}, {'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'categories': ['Murder'], 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=PRF0AgAAQBAJ&dq=17th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'ISBN_13': '9781411698598', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=PRF0AgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=PRF0AgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '1411698592', 'pageCount': 66, 'publisher': 'Lulu.com', 'authors': ['Ian Abel'], 'title': 'Nothing Sacred: the murder of a village parson in 17th century England-a true story', 'id': 'PRF0AgAAQBAJ'}, {'categories': ['History'], 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=qyYRbGzqn08C&dq=17th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'publisher': 'Greenwood Publishing Group', 'title': 'Family Life in 17th- and 18th-century America', 'description': 'Describes the aspects of family life in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, looking at the roles of fathers, mothers, children, servants, and slaves, and how their relationships grew, changed, and ended.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9780313331992', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=qyYRbGzqn08C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=qyYRbGzqn08C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '0313331995', 'pageCount': 323, 'authors': ['James M.

Current changes in climate, sea level and ice are within variability. Atmospheric CO2 is the lowest for 500 million years.

Humans have made their mark on the planet, thrived in warm times and struggled in cool times. The hypothesis that humans can actually change climate is unsupported by evidence from geology, archaeology, history and astronomy. The hypothesis is rejected. A new ignorance fills the yawning spiritual gap in Western society. Climate change politics is religious fundamentalism masquerading as science. Its triumph is computer models unrelated to observations in nature. There has been no critical due diligence of the science of climate change, dogma dominates, sceptics are pilloried and 17th Century thinking promotes prophets of doom, guilt and penance.

He was architect to the crown, to the nobility, and to the city of Stockholm, and he supplied buildings for a wide range of functions, from palaces to banks, courthouses, and fortifications. His unusually extensive travels in the Netherlands, Italy, France and Germany provided him with a comprehensive picture of contemporary European architecture, which he drew on as he synthesized a new group of buildings that would attract international attention as models for princely architecture. His productivity required a new approach to architecture, and he was part of the first generation of architects in northern Europe to develop the architectural studio, distinguishing the design process from the business of building, and in the process recreating himself as the modern architect.

To counter their assaults as well as those of pirates, the Spanish built an outstanding system of fortifications – much of which still stands today. This title will cover the three main periods of development including the first ‘castles’ in Americas based on medieval styles built to protect against marauding adventurers including Sir Francis Drake. Later these forts were adapted to reflect the improved power of artillery. Following the fall of Havana to the British in 1762, the defences of the Spanish Main were revealed as outmoded and a complete reconstruction of them was ordered in the final stage of development as tremendous Vauban-style fortifications were created.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9781846030055', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=nGh4l_SuvdUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=nGh4l_SuvdUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '1846030056', 'pageCount': 64, 'authors': ['Rene Chartrand'], 'id': 'nGh4l_SuvdUC'}, {'categories': ['Travel'], 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=GWC5k4T5Y48C&dq=17th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'publisher': 'Casa Editrice Bonechi', 'title': 'Mosca.

Exploring the distinctive social worlds that have been created by racial oppression over nearly four centuries and what this has meant for the people of the United States, focusing his analysis on white-on-black oppression. Drawing on the commentaries of black and white Americans in three historical eras; the slavery era, the legal segregation era, and then those of white Americans. Feagin examines how major institutions have been thoroughly pervaded by racial stereotypes, ideas, images, emotions, and practices. He theorizes that this system of racial oppression was not an accident of history, but was created intentionally by white Americans. While significant changes have occurred in this racist system over the centuries, key and fundamentally elements have been reproduced over nearly four centuries, and US institutions today imbed the racialized hierarchy created in the 17th century. Today, as in the past, racial oppression is not just a surface-level feature of society, but rather it pervades, permeates, and interconnects all major social groups, networks, and institutions across society.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9780415952781', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=z-v8_BkQ2n8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=z-v8_BkQ2n8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '0415952786', 'pageCount': 365, 'authors': ['Joe R.

Despite their efforts, the voices of those who claim to have found the essence of Confucianism are as much at odds as ever. A Topography of Confucian Discourse analyzes Confucian discussion in diverse historical settings, examining how Confucianism has served the different purposes of biased interpreters and how they have manipulated Confucian discourse. To explore their hidden desires, Lee Seung-hwan critically observes various historical contexts in which people interpreted Confucianism: in the heyday of the Jesuit Missionaries, the eighteenth-century Enlightenment, the period of Western Imperialism, late twentieth-century postmodern America, Tokugawa Japan, Choson Korea, China, Taiwan, South Korea, as well as Singapore. The author successfully historicizes Confucian discourse, explaining why, against a certain political background, a certain view on Confucianism has to arise. ABOUT THE AUTHOR Lee Seung-hwan received his PhD from the University of Hawaii. A professor of philosophy at Korea University, Lee has authored several books including The Sociopolitical Re-illumination of Confucian Thought and The Exchange of E-Mail between the West and the East for 127 Days. Lee has been known as a progressive philosopher of Chinese philosophy and has dealt with the inherent conflicts in liberal political thought.

Similarly the book traces the family of Johann Gottfried (Godfrey) Nienhaus, a nephew of Jacob (Stephen) Gruben, who also came to the United States at about the same time. The book contains information on the first generation of the Nienhaus family that was born in the United States. The book is of wider interest because there is a discussion of the nature of and idiosyncrasies of the German civil registration and Catholic records available in the DŸsseldorf / Cologne area of Germany. There is an extensive discussion of a method of determining a family line when faced with the sometimes scant information available in the early Catholic Church records. There are large numbers of collateral relatives listed in the lines of descendants contained in the book with over 1800 people listed, most of whom were born, lived and died in the DŸsseldorf / Cologne area of Germany. There is a surname index to the lines of descendants in the Gruben section and a surname index to the lines of descendants in the KrŠmer section of the book.

The first concerns the controversies on the nature of the subject and related notions, such as the concepts of ‘I’ and ‘self’. From both theoretical and historical viewpoints, several of the contributors show how different and incompatible perspectives on the subject can help us understand today’s world, its habits, style, power relations, and attitudes. For this purpose, use is made of insights in a broad range of disciplines, such as sociology, psychoanalysis, pragmatics, intellectual history, and anthropology. This interdisciplinary approach helps to clarify the multifaceted character of the subject and the role it plays nowadays as well as over the centuries. The second issue concerns the subject in inter-personal as well as in intra-personal controversies. The enquiry here focuses on the ways in which different aspects of the subject and subjective differences affect the conduct, content, and rationality of controversies with others as well as within oneself on a variety of topics. Among such aspects, the contributors analyse the subject’s emotions, cognitive states, argumentative practices, and individual and collective identity. The interaction between the two issues, the controversies on the subject and the subject of controversies, sheds new light on the debate on modernity and its alleged crisis.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9789027294258', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=UZM6AAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=UZM6AAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '9027294259', 'pageCount': 411, 'authors': ['Pierluigi Barrotta', 'Marcelo Dascal'], 'id': 'UZM6AAAAQBAJ'}, {'categories': ['Art'], 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=JhIxrykbrKUC&dq=17th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'averageRating': 3.5, 'publisher': 'Cambridge University Press', 'subtitle': 'The Golden Age', 'title': 'The Dutch Republic in the Seventeenth Century', 'description': "The Dutch are 'the envy of some, the fear of others, and the wonder of all their neighbours'.

Vanessa Martin argues that Qajar government was certainly despotic, but was also founded on a consensus understood in deed rather than word, derived from consultation and bargaining. Looking at urban society, the author shows how all levels were involved, and focuses on the role of non-elite groups, whose networks organised the struggles with the authorities. The Islamic principles governing the relationship between state and society were derived ultimately from the concept of al-Mizan, the balance, which formed the basis for the consensus. As the discussion reaches the eve of the constitutional revolution, the changes of the 1890s reveal how the mass of contemporaries saw the revolution, and what they expected from it, and how the international economy shaped opinion. _x000D_ _x000D_ Three case studies discuss the political participation of the people: Bushire, where they aided the elimination of intermediary powers, and collaborated with the state against the British; Shiraz, where the relentless struggle to control a turbulent population interacted with the relationship between state and tribes; and Isfahan, where state and populace had learned to manage each other up to the 1890s. Four thematic chapters cover firstly women in popular political demonstrations, linking them to the choreography of the passion plays; the role of the lutis, the unruly poor, in ensuring social justice in communal battles with the state; the lives of soldiers as an example of one of the poorest social groups, demonstrating the abiding weakness of the army, compared to the prospering cities; and finally the lot of slaves in an Islamic society, with reference to one particular case, Hajji Bashir Khan.

The cases examined begin in 1638, extend to the Salem outbreak in 1692, and document for the first time the extensive Stamford-Fairfield, Connecticut, witch-hunt of 1692–1693. Here one encounters witch-hunts through the eyes of those who participated in them: the accusers, the victims, the judges. The original texts tell in vivid detail a multi-dimensional story that conveys not only the process of witch-hunting but also the complexity of culture and society in early America. The documents capture deep-rooted attitudes and expectations and reveal the tensions, anger, envy, and misfortune that underlay communal life and family relationships within New England’s small towns and villages. Primary sources include court depositions as well as excerpts from the diaries and letters of contemporaries. They cover trials for witchcraft, reports of diabolical possessions, suits of defamation, and reports of preternatural events. Each section is preceded by headnotes that describe the case and its background and refer the reader to important secondary interpretations. In his incisive introduction, David D. Hall addresses a wide range of important issues: witchcraft lore, antagonistic social relationships, the vulnerability of women, religious ideologies, popular and learned understandings of witchcraft and the devil, and the role of the legal system. This volume is an extraordinarily significant resource for the study of gender, village politics, religion, and popular culture in seventeenth-century New England./div', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9780822336136', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=EMDabpjdotYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=EMDabpjdotYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '0822336138', 'pageCount': 378, 'authors': ['David D.

At every point of this Euro-Asian encounter, the emerging Catholic communities attempted to twist and turn their own received religion to fit their various collective and/or individual interests. This turning or "troping" of the Jesuit message into pre-Christian modes of religious expression produced the "tropics" of the title. Drawing upon a variety of sources in Portuguese, Italian, Spanish, Latin and Tamil, Missionary Tropics documents the construction of the Indian vernacular Catholicism or "Tropical Catholicism" through a complex layering of missionary religious and social intentions and indigenous responses. By following Galenic humoral medical theory, the Catholic missionaries defined paganism as a natural outgrowth of the hot and humid climate. Reflecting the complex layering of the missionaries\' religious and social intentions and the subsequent indigenous responses, this book should be of interest to all those who study religious encounters and are interested in the issues of religious conversion in the early modern world, in India, and elsewhere.

He wrote 17 books, each covering the diseases of a separate part of the body, and his collected works were published in Latin in 1655 in a single volume, The Practice of Physick. There were many subsequent editions, including several editions of the English translation by the famous London herbalist Nicholas Culpeper. Riviere's Book 15, Of the Diseases of Women, gives a good insight into the way 17th century medicine was practised, with its great emphasis on the regulation of the 'humours' by the use of herbal and other natural remedies. It also provides a marvellous view of the miseries which most medieval women, rich and poor, would have had to suffer during the ordeals of pregnancy and childbirth at that time.

Discussing the popularity of crime fiction worldwide and its various styles; the role that gender plays within the genre; spy fiction, and legal dramas and thrillers; he explores how the crime novel was shaped by the work of British and American authors in the 18th and 19th centuries. Highlighting the works of notorious authors such as Edgar Allan Poe, Conan Doyle, Agatha Christie, and Raymond Chandler -- to name but a few -- he considers the role of the crime novel in modern popular culture and asks whether we can, and whether we should, consider crime fiction serious "literature".

Mr. Morris shows that the religious poetry of eighteenth-century England, while not equaling the brilliant work of seventeenth-century and Romantic writers, does reveal a vital and serious effort to create a new kind of sacred poetry which would rival the sublimity of Milton and of the Bible itself. Tracing the major varieties of religious poetry written throughout the century -- by major figures and by their now vanished contemporaries -- the author explains how later poets and critics made significant departures from the established norms.

As the position of poetry was more and more threatened, its defenders made ever higher claims for its importance, even maintaining for a time that it would take the place of religion. But, though the Romantics brought about a sustained revival of serious poetry for a broad audience, the audience began to dwindle toward the end of the nineteenth century, and the decline accelerated as the twentieth century advanced. Though some of the cultural changes responsible for this retreat were beyond the control of poets -- "a society in which many people find their chief security and sense of meaning through the possession of certain objects will produce great advertising, not great poetry" -- Clausen finds in this situation evidence of an abdication among artists. Because modernist poets and their successors abandoned some indispensable principles, he believes, serious contemporary poetry now has virtually no audience outside of English departments. Yet the need for poetry "is not less in an era like ours," and "the opportunities that the end of the twentieth century offers to poetry will not become fully apparent unless and until poets take advantage of them."', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9780813162546', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=9dgeBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=9dgeBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '0813162548', 'pageCount': 226, 'authors': ['Carl B.

The essays show men and women working together, praising and criticizing each other\'s work, borrowing -- and changing -- each other\'s plots and characters, recording their different perceptions of their common world. From Dryden\'s praise of Anne Killigrew, through Gay\'s and Lady Mary Wortley Montagu\'s collaboration on a town eclogue, Thomas Southerne\'s dramatizations of novels by Aphra Behn, and Eliza Haywood\'s version of the Spectator, to Cornelia Knight\'s sequel to Rasselas, these relationships demonstrate that men and women writers inhabited the same literary world, shared the traditions of the mainstream of English literature. Most of the women have since faded from view. But Messenger suggests the time has come to rediscover them, to reassess their work, and to revise the commonly accepted canon of literature accordingly. Although most of the studies deal with the way women\'s writing responds to writing by men, the Afterword combats the charge that the women\'s work is "derivative." Free of critical jargon and ideological strait-jacketing, His and Hers makes some little-known writers available and interesting to specialists and nonspecialists, feminists and traditionalists, alike, while it sheds new light on some of the most familiar figures of the period. The Appendix reprints some of the shorter works which have been analyzed in detail, and summaries in the text help to compensate for the unavailability of some of the women\'s books. The comparative approach suggests a wide and rich field for further research.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9780813163888', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NeIeBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NeIeBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '0813163889', 'pageCount': 288, 'authors': ['Ann Messenger'], 'id': 'NeIeBgAAQBAJ'}, {'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'categories': ['Travel'], 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=iAVYBQAAQBAJ&dq=18th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'ISBN_13': '9781465438317', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=iAVYBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=iAVYBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '1465438319', 'pageCount': 348, 'publisher': 'Penguin', 'title': 'DK Eyewitness Travel Guide: Argentina', 'description': "The DK Eyewitness Travel Guide: Argentina is your indispensable guide to this beautiful part of the world.

This work has been inspired in part by two apparently quite different but actually related contemporary trends: on the one hand, an emergence or revitalization of clusters of activities co-located in or around selected global city regions or fast growing metropolitan areas; and on the other hand, an increased global dispersion of activities conducted within the value chains managed or coordinated by many large multinational enterprises and their business partners. The former trend has given rise to discussions of how the elite of the cultural-cognitive economy of the 21st century (in Allen Scott's terminology) or the creative class (Richard Florida's term) are now being drawn or brought back to major urban centers; while the latter trend is associated with debates over outsourcing, and the economic and social consequences of shifts in the ownership and location of distinct nodes of value chains once production systems become more fragmented and the component parts of such systems become more geographically dispersed. An increased interest in the subject of international business location has been shown by scholars in Strategic Management, in Economic Geography, and in Regional Science, as well as in our own interdisciplinary field of International Business Studies. However, as is often the case in academic research communities, these bodies of scholarship have tended to develop at something of a distance from one another, each conversing internally more than they have with one another. Location of International Business Activities aims to promote a greater conversation between those interested in the topic of Location from various different backgrounds or starting points.

Beiser tells the story of the emergence of neo-Kantianism from the late 1790s until the 1880s. He focuses on neo-Kantianism before official or familiar neo-Kantianism, i.e., before the formation of the various schools of neo-Kantianism in the 1880s and 1890s (which included the Marburg school, the Southwestern school, and the Göttingen school). Beiser argues that the source of neo-Kantianism lies in three crucial but neglected figures: Jakob Friedrich Fries, Johann Friedrich Herbart, and Friedrich Beneke, who together form what he calls 'the lost tradition'. They are the first neo-Kantians because they defended Kant's limits on knowledge against the excesses of speculative idealism, because they upheld Kant's dualisms against their many critics, and because they adhered to Kant's transcendental idealism. Much of The Genesis of Neo-Kantianism, 1796-1880 is devoted to an explanation for the rise of neo-Kantianism. Beiser contends that it became a greater force in the decades from 1840 to 1860 in response to three major developments in German culture: the collapse of speculative idealism; the materialism controversy; and the identity crisis of philosophy. As he goes on to argue, after the 1860s neo-Kantianism became a major philosophical force because of its response to two later cultural developments: the rise of pessimism and Darwinism.", 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9780191030994', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=nU1VBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=nU1VBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '0191030996', 'pageCount': 624, 'authors': ['Frederick C.

By shifting focus from a cultural-historicist approach to sociability to the rhizomatic nature of eighteenth-century associations, this collection approaches them through new methodological lenses that include social network analysis, assemblage and graph theory, social media and digital humanities scholarship. Imagining the eighteenth-century world as a networked community rather than a competing one reflects a recent interest in novel forms of social interaction facilitated by new social media—from Internet forums to various types of social networking sites—and also signals the increasing involvement of academic communities in digital humanities projects that use new technologies to map out patterns of intellectual exchange. As such, the articles included in this collection demonstrate the benefits of applying interdisciplinary approaches to eighteenth-century sociability, and their role in shedding new light on the way public opinion was formed and ideas disseminated during pre-modern times. The issues addressed by our contributors are of paramount importance for understanding the eighteenth-century culture of sociability. They address, among other things, clubbing practices and social networking strategies (political, cultural, gender-based) in the eighteenth-century world, the role of clubs and other associations in “improving” knowledge and behaviors, conflicting views on publicity, literary and political alliances and their importance for an emerging celebrity culture, the role of cross-national networks in launching pan-European and transatlantic trends, Romantic modes of sociability, as well as the contribution of voluntary associations (clubs, literary salons, communities of readers, etc.) to the formation of the public sphere.

Unlike their parents and grandparents, the younger Saudis consider these customary and traditional norms to be outdated and incompatible with the current times. Furthermore, the present generation’s openness to outside views on religion, politics, education, society and women’s rights have polarized the Saudi society, triggered public debates and conflicts amongst conservatives versus liberals, traditionalists versus modernists, and the religious versus the seculars. As Saudi youths strive to bring their society into the twenty-first century, more Saudi women are stepping up to be heard, not willing to be controlled and defined by what they consider oppressive. They dared to expand their roles and rights as well as embrace their emerging independence as they simultaneously live out both their professional and private lives. These empowered women champion freedom, equality, independence—and respect.

His most famous work, the Homeric novel Les Aventures de Télémaque, Fils d’Ulysse (1699), composed for the education of his pupil Duc de Bourgogne, was, after the Bible, the most widely read literary work in France throughout the eighteenth century. It was also translated and adapted into many other European languages. And yet oddly enough, the question as to why Fénelon’s ideas resonated over such a wide span of space and time has as yet found no coherent and comprehensive answer. By taking Fénelon’s intellectual influence as a matter of ‘cultural translation’, this anthology traces the reception of Fénelon and his multifaceted writings outside of France, and in doing so aims to enrich not only our understanding of the Enlightenment, but also of the thinker himself.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9789401210645', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=7OCaBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=7OCaBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '9401210640', 'pageCount': 393, 'authors': ['Christoph Schmitt-Maaß', 'Stefanie Stockhorst', 'Doohwan Ahn'], 'id': '7OCaBQAAQBAJ'}, {'categories': ['Performing Arts'], 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=sCxuBAAAQBAJ&dq=18th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'publisher': 'Bloomsbury Publishing', 'title': "Pattern Cutting for Men's Costume", 'description': "Pattern Cutting for Men's Costume is a practical guide featuring patterns for the most important garments worn by men between the 16th and 19th centuries.

What united them was their shared interest in the history of the judicial institutions of the Ancien Régime and especially the records of a trial which had been housed for two centuries in the Venetian Ducal Palace before passing, along with other precious documents of the Serenissima, to the provisional seat of San Teodoro in Venice where, along with others, worked the archivist Agostino Carli Rubbi. Alessandro Manzoni became famous for his novel, I promessi sposi (The Betrothed), which he claimed was inspired by an anonymous manuscript of the 1600s and which became the Italian national novel. Indeed, both the characters and the complicated plot that unites them can be found in a file of a trial from the early 17th century.

This is a region justly famed for some of the finest and most unspoilt scenery in the British Isles – but what happened here in times past? Scotland's Northwest Frontier provides the answer. For a long time, this area was a frontier zone between the medieval kingdoms of Norway and Scotland, and then between the Gaelic Lords of the Isles and the Scottish kings. In the 18th century, this remote seaboard was Britain’s ‘Afghanistan’, a dangerous region often beyond the control of London and Edinburgh. It was the last hiding place of Bonnie Prince Charlie before his escape to France after his Jacobite army had been crushed on Culloden Moor. A land of clans and lost causes, this is the story of powerful lords and warrior chiefs, Presbyterian soldiers of the Covenant and Hanoverian redcoats, Highland Clearances, road and railway builders, whisky smugglers and opium traders, from Viking times to the beginning of the 21st century. Scotland's Northwest Frontier is the entertaining story of what was for long a lawless region, followed through eight turbulent centuries.

It explores the insights and limitations of border theory developed primarily in the European context to a range of historical and contemporary border-related issues and phenomena in East Asia. The essays presented here question, rather than assume, the various borders between inclusion/exclusion, here/there, us/them, that condition the (im)possibility of translating between histories, cultures and identities. Contributors suggest that the act of translation offers new ways of thinking about how border logics operate, taking on the concept of translation itself as border problematic and therefore raising questions of power and authority, such as who gets to act as a translator, or who benefits from the outcome. The book will appeal not only to upper-level students and scholars with a geopolitical-historical interest in East Asia, but also to those who work in the inter-disciplinary field of border studies and others with an interest more generally in translation and the extent to which theory ‘travels’ across time and space.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9781135011536', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=k-1TBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=k-1TBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '1135011532', 'pageCount': 226, 'authors': ['Joyce C.H.

Generally perceived as an important service to the state and the nation, translation was also viewed as a high art, leading many Russian poets and writers to engage in literary translation in a serious and sustained manner. As a result, translations were generally regarded as an integral part of an author’s oeuvre and of Russian literature as a whole. This volume brings together Russian writings on translation from the mid-18th century until today and presents them in chronological order, providing valuable insights into the theory and practice of translation in Russia. Authored by some of Russia’s leading writers, such as Aleksandr Pushkin, Fedor Dostoevskii, Lev Tolstoi, Maksim Gorkii, and Anna Akhmatova, many of these texts are translated into English for the first time. They are accompanied by extensive annotation and biographical sketches of the authors, and reveal Russian translation discourse to be a sophisticated and often politicized exploration of Russian national identity, as well as the nature of the modern subject. Russian Writers on Translation fills a persistent gap in the literature on alternative translation traditions, highlighting the vibrant and intense culture of translation on Europe’s ‘periphery’. Viewed in a broad cultural context, the selected texts reflect a nuanced understanding of the Russian response to world literature and highlight the attempts of Russian writers to promote Russia as an all-inclusive cultural model.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9781317640035', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=wPwJBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=wPwJBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '1317640039', 'pageCount': 192, 'authors': ['Brian James Baer', 'Natalia Olshanskaya'], 'id': 'wPwJBAAAQBAJ'}, {'categories': ['Social Science'], 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=ptX_AwAAQBAJ&dq=18th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'publisher': 'Princeton University Press', 'subtitle': 'The Uses of Loyalty', 'title': 'Servants and Masters in 18th-Century France', 'description': 'Here is the first major study of domestic service in France from the late seventeenth century to the early nineteenth century, describing its transformation from a male-oriented occupation, aristocratic in style and often geared to public display, to one that was female, middle-class, and centered on the household.

Examined here are first the experimental writings of the early years of the twentieth century--Rozanov, Remizov, and Bely; second, the unique autobiographical statements of the mid-1920s through the early 1940s--Mandelstam, Pasternak, Olesha, and Zoshchenko; and finally, the diverse and vital contemporary writings of the 1960s through the 1980s as exemplified not only by creative writers but also by scholars, by Soviet citizens as well as by emigrs--Trifonov, Nadezhda Mandelstam, Lydia Ginzburg, Nabokov, Jakobson, Sinyavsky, and Limonov.

This indicator serves as a bellwether for gauging the health and spread of democracy. Historical Guide to World Media Freedom brings together comprehensive historical data on media freedom since World War II, providing consistent and comparable measures of media freedom in all independent countries for the years 1948 to the present. The work also includes country-by country summaries, analyses of historical and regional trends in media freedom, and extensive reliability analyses of media freedom measures. The book’s detailed information helps researchers connect historical measures of media freedom to Freedom House’s annual Freedom of the Press survey release, enabling them to extend their studies back before the 1980s when Freedom House began compiling global press freedom measures. Key Features: A-to-Z, country-by-country summaries of the ebb and flow of media freedom are paired with national media freedom measures over time. Introductory chapters discuss such topics as the theoretical premises behind the nature and importance of media freedom, historical trends, and the challenges of coding for media freedom in a way that ensures consistency for comparison. Concluding material covers the historical patterns in media freedom, how media freedom tracks with other cross-national indicators, and more.

In many aspects, this art was linked to its predecessor, Baroque, and it is thus also referred to as late Baroque style. While artists such as Tiepolo, Boucher and Reynolds carried the style to its apogee, the movement was often condemned for its superficiality. In the second half of the 18th century, Rococo began its decline. At the end of the century, facing the advent of Neoclassicism, it was plunged into obscurity. It had to wait nearly a century before art historians could restore it to the radiance of its golden age, which is rediscovered in this work by Klaus H.

His works have been called brilliant and unbearable, poetic and documentary, classic and controversial. He is a major voice of the Civil Rights Movement. His words, which have compelled, agitated and hypnotized a nation, are now heard around the world. That is the public image of James Baldwin. But there is also an aspect of Baldwin that grew out of self-deprecation and a search for personal identity; a timorous side that his mother worried over in the presence of a step-father who would not acknowledge him, and that his teachers watched carefully because there was precocity beneath it, trying to force its way out. There was a child who thought he was ugly and useless, who was overly self-conscious about his appearance and couldn’t find the love he needed to make his own existence bearable. There is a man who claims: “I’ve been scared to death since I was born and I’ll be scared till I die. But if you’re scared to death, walk toward it.” And there is an author whose tremendous impact on American literature—and American life—has, until now, not been fully measured. Fern Marja Eckman has based this vivid book on hours and hours of taped interviews with Baldwin and with the people who are significant in his story. She presents a detailed account of Baldwin’s Harlem childhood, a portrait of the exile who returned to his country to shock it into reappraisal of its racial and sexual attitudes, and an inside view of his part in Robert Kennedy’s civil-rights meeting in 1963. Speaking with James Baldwin and probing the complex mixture of extreme hate and intense love that characterize him, she presents a profile told largely in his own words—one which is essentially Baldwin on Baldwin.', 'id': '0DKsBgAAQBAJ'}, {'categories': ['Business & Economics'], 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=UFIHAwAAQBAJ&dq=18th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'publisher': 'Cambridge University Press', 'title': 'Life and Labour in the Nineteenth Century', 'description': 'First published in 1947, this book examines the climate surrounding life and labour in Britain in the nineteenth century.

But why do states follow different secularizing strategies? The literature has already shattered the illusion that secularization of the state has been a unilinear, homogeneous and universal process, and has convincingly shown that secularization of the state has unfolded along different paths. Much, however, remains to be uncovered. This book provides an in-depth comparative historical analysis of state secularization in three major Eurasian countries: Turkey, Iran and Russia. To capture the aforementioned variation in state secularization across three countries that have been hitherto analyzed as separate studies, Birol Başkan adopts three modes of state secularization: accommodationism, separationism and eradicationism. Focusing thematically on the changing relations between the state and religious institutions, Başkan brings together a host of factors, historical, strategic and structural, to account for why Turkey adopted accommodationism, Iran separationism and Russia eradicationism. In doing so, he expertly demonstrates that each secularization strategy was a rational response to the strategic context the reformers found themselves in.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9781317802044', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=t0MsAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=t0MsAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '1317802047', 'pageCount': 218, 'authors': ['Birol Başkan'], 'id': 't0MsAwAAQBAJ'}, {'categories': ['Philosophy'], 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=T9IVAwAAQBAJ&dq=18th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'publisher': 'OUP Oxford', 'title': 'Kant and Rational Psychology', 'description': "Corey W. Dyck presents a new account of Kant's criticism of the rational investigation of the soul in his monumental Critique of Pure Reason, in light of its eighteenth-century German context. When characterizing the rational psychology that is Kant's target in the Paralogisms of Pure Reason chapter of the Critique commentators typically only refer to an approach to, and an account of, the soul found principally in the thought of Descartes and Leibniz. But Dyck argues that to do so is to overlook the distinctive rational psychology developed by Christian Wolff, which emphasized the empirical foundation of any rational cognition of the soul, and which was widely influential among eighteenth-century German philosophers, including Kant. In this book, Dyck reveals how the received conception of the aim and results of Kant's Paralogisms must be revised in light of a proper understanding of the rational psychology that is the most proximate target of Kant's attack. In particular, he contends that Kant's criticism hinges upon exposing the illusory basis of the rational psychologist's claims inasmuch as he falls prey to the appearance of the soul as being given in inner experience. Moreover, Dyck demonstrates that significant light can be shed on Kant's discussion of the soul's substantiality, simplicity, personality, and existence by considering the Paralogisms in this historical context.", 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9780191512629', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=T9IVAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=T9IVAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '0191512621', 'pageCount': 288, 'authors': ['Corey W.

W. Leibniz published Theodicy: Essays on the Goodness of God, the Freedom of Man, and the Origin of Evil. This book, the only one he published in his lifetime, established his reputation more than anything else he wrote. The Theodicy brings together many different strands of Leibniz's own philosophical system, and we get a rare snapshot of how he intended these disparate aspects of his philosophy to come together into a single, overarching account of divine justice in the face of the world's evils. At the same time, the Theodicy is a fascinating window into the context of philosophical theology in the seventeenth century. Leibniz had his finger on the intellectual pulse of his time, and this comes out very clearly in the Theodicy. He engages with all of the major lines of theological dispute of that time, demonstrating the encyclopaedic breadth of his understanding of the issues. Leibniz's Theodicy remains one of the most abiding systematic accounts of how evil is compatible with divine goodness. Any treatment of the problem of evil must, at some point, come to grips with Leibniz's proposed solution. This volume refreshes and deepens our understanding of this great work.

In particular, it scrutinizes epistemic exchanges between producers of the arts and alchemists. In the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries the term laboratorium uniquely referred to workplaces in which 'chemical' operations were performed: smelting, combustion, distillation, dissolution, and precipitation. Artisanal workshops equipped with furnaces and fire in which 'chemical' operations were performed were also known as laboratories. Transmutational alchemy (the transmutation of all base metals into more noble ones, especially gold) was only one aspect of alchemy in the early modern period. The practice of alchemy was also about the chemical production of things--medicines, porcelain, dyes, and other products as well as precious metals--and about the knowledge of how to produce them. This book uses examples such as the Uffizi to discuss how Renaissance courts established spaces where artisanal workshops and laboratories were brought together, thus facilitating the circulation of materials, people and knowledge between the worlds of craft (today's decorative arts) and alchemy. Artisans became involved in alchemical pursuits beyond a shared material culture and some crafts relied on chemical expertise offered by scholars trained as alchemists. Above all, texts and books, products and symbols of scholarly culture played an increasingly important role in artisanal workshops. In these workplaces a sort of hybrid figure was at work. With one foot in artisanal and the other in scholarly culture this hybrid practitioner is impossible to categorize in the mutually exclusive categories of scholar and craftsman. By the seventeenth century the expertise of some glassmakers, silver- and goldsmiths and producers of porcelain was just as based in the worlds of alchemical and bookish learning as it was grounded in hands-on work in the laboratory. This book suggests that this shift in workshop culture facilitated the epistemic exchanges between alchemists and producers of the decorative arts.", 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9783319050652', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=KK69BAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=KK69BAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '3319050656', 'pageCount': 220, 'authors': ['Sven Dupré'], 'id': 'KK69BAAAQBAJ'}, {'categories': ['Education'], 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=5VBwBAAAQBAJ&dq=18th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'publisher': 'Cram101 Textbook Reviews', 'title': 'e-Study Guide for: The West: Encounters and Tranformations', 'description': 'Never Highlight a Book Again!

Many scientists who have helped to develop the methods of analytical chemistry are mentioned. Various methods of analysis are discussed, including electrogravimetry, optical methods, electrometric analysis, radiochemical analysis, and chromatography. This volume is comprised of 14 chapters and begins with an overview of analytical chemistry in ancient Greece, the origin of chemistry, and the earliest knowledge of analysis. The next chapter focuses on analytical chemistry during the Middle Ages, with emphasis on alchemy. Analytical knowledge during the period of iatrochemistry and the development of analytical chemistry during the phlogiston period are then examined. Subsequent chapters deal with the development of the fundamental laws of chemistry, including the principle of the indestructibility of matter; analytical chemistry during the period of Berzelius; and developments in qualitative and gravimetric analysis. Elementary organic analysis is also considered, along with the development of the theory of analytical chemistry.

Michael Hoskin shows that William Herschel was the first observational cosmologist and one of the first observers to attack the sidereal universe beyond the solar system: Herschel built instruments far better than any being used at the royal observatory. Aided by his sister Caroline, he commenced a great systematic survey that led to his discovery of Uranus in 1781. Unlike observers before him, whose telescopes did not reveal them as astronomical objects, Herschel did not ignore misty patches of light. Hoskins points out Herschel’s achievement in surveying, cataloguing, and describing them as “nebulae” and even coming to the correct conclusion that their structure evolved over time, with Newton’s gravity being the agent of change. Herschel’s surveys established a new astronomy – looking at the universe rather than the planets! Michael Hoskin’s account includes sketches and diagrams from Herschel’s manuscripts in the Royal Astronomical Society Archives in which he attempts to delineate the structure of the Milky Way galaxy. While it is well-known that Herschel was a revolutionary in telescope design who constructed the world’s largest telescopes, Hoskin also gives the full picture of the man as an entrepreneur who built and traded some 400 telescopes. Hoskin also pays close attention to the role of William's sister Caroline Herschel, who is usually portrayed as a “helpmate” to her brother. But in fact she became a significant astronomer in her own right. This book also offers a wealth of information of the wider Herschel family. It is enriched by a complete set of portraits of William and Caroline Herschel with an extensive set of images of their residences and closes with a charming appendix on how visitors to the Herschels recorded their encounters. William and Caroline Herschel – Pioneers in Late 18th-Century Astronomy will appeal to amateur astronomers and all those interested in popular astronomy. This book will rapidly establish itself as the primary introductory work for students, astronomers, and scholars working on the history of natural science in the late 18th century.", 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9789400768758', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=IhHHBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=IhHHBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '9400768753', 'pageCount': 112, 'authors': ['Michael Hoskin'], 'id': 'IhHHBAAAQBAJ'}, {'categories': ['Antiques & Collectibles'], 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=1Nd1to88GGoC&dq=18th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'averageRating': 3.5, 'publisher': 'Icon Books', 'subtitle': 'A compendium of absorbing history, stories and facts from the world of antiques', 'title': 'The Antiques Magpie', 'description': 'From the mythical artefacts of the ancient world to saucy seaside postcards, The Antiques Magpie explores the wonderful world of antiques and collectables.

Laura Maria Caterina Bassi (1711-1778) defended 49 Theses at the University of Bologna on April 17, 1732 and was awarded a doctoral degree on May 12 of the same year. Three weeks before her defense, she was made a member of the Academy of Sciences in Bologna. On June 27 she defended 12 additional Theses. Several of the 61 Theses were on physics and other science topics. Laura was drawn by the philosophy of Newton at a time when most scientists in Europe were still focused on Descartes and Galen. This last set of Theses was to encourage the University of Bologna to provide a lectureship to Laura, which they did on October 29, 1732. Although quite famous in her day, Laura Bassi is unfortunately not remembered much today. This book presents Bassi within the context of the century when she lived and worked, an era where no women could attend university anywhere in the world, and even less become a professor or a member of an academy. Laura was appointed to the Chair of experimental physics in 1776 until her death. Her story is an amazing one. Laura was a mother, a wife and a good scientist for over 30 years. She made the transition from the old science to the new very early on in her career. Her work was centered on real problems that the City of Bologna needed to solve. It was an exciting time of discovery and she was at the edge of it all the way.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9783642386855', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=POa9BAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=POa9BAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '3642386857', 'pageCount': 196, 'authors': ['Monique Frize'], 'id': 'POa9BAAAQBAJ'}, {'categories': ['Social Science'], 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=mc4pBgAAQBAJ&dq=18th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'publisher': 'Springer Science & Business Media', 'subtitle': 'Separating the Spheres in Urban America', 'title': 'The Archaeology of Gender', 'description': 'Historical archaeologists often become so involved in their potsherd patterns they seldom have time or energy left to address the broader processes responsi ble for the material culture patterns they recognize.

The book sets out the emergence of shareholder primacy orientated corporate governance using a study of historical developments in the United Kingdom and the United States. Talbot sees shareholder primacy as a political choice made by governments, not a ‘natural’ feature of the inevitable market. She describes the periods of progressive corporate governance which governments promoted in the middle of the 20th century using a close examination of the theories of the company which then prevailed. She critically examines the rise of neoliberal theories on the company and corporate governance and argues that they have had a negative and regressive impact on social and economic development. In examining contemporary corporate governance she shows how regulatory styles as informed and described by prevailing regulatory theories, enables neoliberal outcomes. She illustrates how United Kingdom-derived corporate governance codes have informed the corporate governance initiatives of European and global institutions. From this she argues that neoliberalism has re-entered ex command transition economies through those United Kingdom and OECD inspired corporate governance Codes over a decade after the earlier failed and destructive neoliberal prescriptions for transition had been rejected. Throughout, Talbot argues that shareholder primacy has socially regressive outcomes and firmly takes a stand against current initiatives to enhance shareholder voting in such issues as director remuneration. The book concludes with a series of proposals to recalibrate the power between those involved in company activity; shareholders, directors and employees so that the public company can begin to work for the public and not shareholders.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9781136233142', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=GvHqnPH1lhEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=GvHqnPH1lhEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '1136233148', 'pageCount': 272, 'authors': ['Lorraine Talbot'], 'id': 'GvHqnPH1lhEC'}, {'categories': ['BUSINESS & ECONOMICS'], 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=ZOIdUlWpapIC&dq=18th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'publisher': 'Routledge', 'title': 'Progressive Corporate Governance for the 21st Century', 'description': '"This book provides a critical and comparative approach to corporate governance. The book sets out, and makes a case for what the author terms \'progressive corporate governance\', in order to promote an approach to corporations which furthers social progress. The book takes a hybrid approach in order to bridge the gap between theory and practice, and assesses the situation in Anglo-American, European and transitional economies. The book argues that in judging which governance theories and practices are progressive one must consider them in historical and social context and it also considers whether there are some governance approaches which may be said to be universally progressive. The book looks at progressive corporate governance in the light of the recent worldwide economic crises and explores how state intervention should proceed.

Whatever can be said is coloured by our dreams and aspirations, by the way our brain works, by human nature and human culture. Whoever claims to know or to observe is - according to the central constructivist assumption - inescapably biased. This book presents the views of the founders of constructivism and modern systems theory, who are still providing stimulating cues for international scientific debate. The conversations of Heinz von Foerster, Ernst von Glasersfeld, Humberto R. Maturana, Francisco J. Varela, Gerhard Roth, Siegfried J. Schmidt, Helm Stierlin, and Paul Watzlawick with Bernhard Poerksen, display a kind of thinking that steers clear of rigid fixation and reveals the ideal of objectivity to be a myth. The conversations turn on the results of brain research, the breaks through of cybernetics, the linguistic determination of thought, and the intrinsic connection between epistemology and ethical practice. Throughout, the central figure of the observer is examined with sophisticated wit and just enough irritating grit to create the pearl in the oyster. Constructivism thus emerges as a philosophy of possibilities that keeps generating new points of view, insists on fundamental scepticism with regard to certainties and dogmas, and provides the foundation for an ethics of perception: Each and every one of us is responsible for their view of things.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9781845404703', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=raO7BAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=raO7BAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '184540470X', 'pageCount': 235, 'authors': ['Bernhard Poerksen'], 'id': 'raO7BAAAQBAJ'}, {'categories': ['Business & Economics'], 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=ry3-EOV76gIC&dq=18th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'publisher': 'Routledge', 'subtitle': 'A Study of the Image of the Malays, Filipinos and Javanese from the 16th to the 20th Century and Its Function in the Ideology of Colonial Capitalism', 'title': 'The Myth of the Lazy Native', 'description': 'The Myth of the Lazy Native is Syed Hussein Alatas’ widely acknowledged critique of the colonial construction of Malay, Filipino and Javanese natives from the 16th to the 20th century.

In Interpretation and Interaction, Jerome Oremland invokes the interventions of "interpretation" and "interaction," rooted in the values of understanding and amelioration, respectively, as a conceptual basis for reappraising these important issues. In place of the commonly accepted triadic division among psychoanalysis, exploratory psychotherapy, and supportive psychotherapy, he proposes a new triad: psychoanalysis, psychoanalytically-oriented psychotherapy, and interactive psychotherapy. Anchoring his classification in what he terms the "orientation of the therapy" rather than the "orientation of the therapist," Oremland submits that analysis and psychoanalytically-oriented psychotherapy strive systematically to interpret the therapeutic interaction as expressed in the transference. Interactive psychotherapy, on the other hand, uses the transference selectively to ameliorate psychic stress. Interpretation and Interaction is enriched by a concluding chapter from Merton Gill, a preeminent authority on the therapeutic process. Gill\'s critical appreciation of Oremland\'s proposals amounts to an illuminating refinement of his own position on the relationship between psychoanalysis and psychotherapy. Scholarly in conception, thoughtful in tone, and pragmatic in yield, Interpretation and Interaction is a clarifying addition to the psychoanalytic theory of psychotherapy. It will have the practical consequence, in Gill\'s words, of "aiding clinicians in retaining their analytic identities and their analytic orientation across the spectrum of their therapeutic work."', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9781134884100', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=xIF37tsdC1oC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=xIF37tsdC1oC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '1134884109', 'pageCount': 192, 'authors': ['Jerome D.

This volume emphasizes developing analytical and writing skills in the contrapuntal technique of the eighteenth century.

Three aspects are stressed throughout: practical work in writing counterpoint, utilizing various textures, devices, and genre of the period; historical background, to establish the origins of different forms and justify the pedagogical method employed here; analysis of selections from music literature, often in voice-leading reductions. After an opening chapter that reviews some general features of the late Baroque period, there is a brief survey of melodic characteristics, and a study of procedures associated with two, three, and four voices.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9781478608769', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=OfgVAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=OfgVAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '1478608765', 'pageCount': 335, 'authors': ['Robert Gauldin'], 'id': 'OfgVAAAAQBAJ'}, {'categories': ['Music'], 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=afAVAAAAQBAJ&dq=18th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'publisher': 'Waveland Press', 'subtitle': 'Revised Edition', 'title': 'A Practical Approach to 16th Century Counterpoint', 'description': 'Practical work in writing counterpoint!

From the field of natural philosophy, involving the science of sounds and acoustics, to the realm of imagination, involving resounding music and art, the branches of modern culture that were involved in the intellectual tradition of the science of music proved to be variously appealing to men of letters. Among these, a particularly rich field of investigation was the British philosophy of the mind and of human understanding, developed between the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, which looked at music and found in its realm a way of understanding human experience. Focussing on the world of sensation – trying to describe how the human mind could develop ideas and emotions by its means – philosophers and physicians often took their cases from art's products, be it music (sounds), painting (colours) or poetry (words as signs of sound conveying a meaning), thus looking at art from a particular point of view: that of the perceiving mind. The relationship between music and the philosophies of mind is presented here as a significant part of the construction of a Science of Man: a huge and impressive 'project' involving both the study of man's nature, to which – in David Hume's words – 'all sciences have a relation', and the creation of an ideal of what Man should be. Maria Semi sheds light on how these reflections moved towards a Science of Music: a complex and articulated vision of the discipline that was later to be known as 'musicology'; or Musikwissenschaft.", 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9781409495161', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=3tqhAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=3tqhAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '1409495167', 'pageCount': 196, 'authors': ['Dr Maria Semi'], 'id': '3tqhAgAAQBAJ'}, {'categories': ['Social Science'], 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=-ym4Fcw4rVoC&dq=18th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'publisher': 'Routledge', 'title': 'Shoguns City', 'description': 'First Published in 1995.

In so doing it is a reading, and re-reading, of the site that adds significantly to the study of Mediterranean urban history over the longue durée . Firstly, the book proposes a new paradigm for the development-history of Butrint - based on discussions of the latest archaeological, historical and landscape studies from approximately 20 new excavations and surveys, together covering a temporal arch from prehistory to the early modern period. Secondly, it examines how the perception of the city influenced the archaeological methodology of 20th-century studies of the site, where iteration and reversal were often being applied in equal measure. In this it asks important questions on the management of heritage sites and the contemporary role of archaeological practise. Inge Lyse Hansen is Adjunct Professor of Art History at John Cabot University and specialises in the visual and material culture of the Roman world. She has published on portraiture, funerary art and the use of role models and patronage and has edited several archaeological volumes.

The fourth son of the Yongzheng Emperor, he reigned officially from 11 October 1735 to 8 February 1796. On 8 February, he abdicated in favor of his son, the Jiaqing Emperor - a filial act in order not to reign longer than his grandfather, the illustrious Kangxi Emperor.

The Principality's flag. The Principality (red) cut the Austrian Netherlands (grey) in two.According to Herve Hasquin, the Liege Revolution mirrored the French Revolution or even formed part of it. Both revolutions began in 1789 and in Hasquin's interpretation the Liege Revolution continued after the prince-bishop's temporary return - he sees a second phase with the entry of French revolutionary troops into Liege in 1792, and a third phase in 1794 with the French's second return. In this interpretation the Liege Revolution only ended in 1795 with the disappearance of the principality and its annexation by France.

Now we see in the past quarter-century how the philosophy of science has been profoundly in fluenced by historical studies of the sciences, and no longer concerned so single-mindedly with the analysis of theory and explanation, with the re lation between hypotheses and experimental observation. Now also we see the traditional historical studies of technology supplemented by phi losophical questions, and no longer so plainly focussed upon contexts of application, on invention and practical engineering, and on the mutually stimulating relations between technology and society. Further, alas, the neat division of intellectual labor, those clearly drawn distinctions be tween science and technology, between the theoretical and the applied, between discovery and justification, between internalist and externalist approaches . . . all, all have become muddled! Partly, this is due to internal revolutions within the philosophy and his tory of science (the first result being recognition of their mutual rele vance). Partly, however, this state of 'muddle' is due to external factors: science, at the least in the last half-century, has become so intimately connected with technology, and technological developments have cre ated so many new fields of scientific (and philosophical) inquiry that any critical reflection on scientific and technological endeavors must hence forth take their interaction into account.", 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9789400945128', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=armLBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=armLBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '9400945124', 'pageCount': 384, 'authors': ['Carl Mitcham', 'Alois Huning'], 'id': 'armLBQAAQBAJ'}, {'categories': ['Language Arts & Disciplines'], 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=WklTBQAAQBAJ&dq=18th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'publisher': 'Springer Science & Business Media', 'title': 'The Comedian as the Letter D: Erasmus Darwin’s Comic Materialism', 'description': 'The Child is father of the Man; And I could wish my days to be Bound each to each by natural piety.

There have been men in between who were both meehanists and poets, who both beIieved in automatic material meehanisms and tried to use the imagination. Erasmus Darwin was one of these "in between" figures. and since he lived early (1731-1802) in the modem scientific era he was one of the first. This older Darwin, the grandfather of Charles, has not been given due credit as a transitional figure in the development of the literature of our scientific era. Although historically and in terms of intelleetual stature the grandfather was a fanciful child compared to the giant grand soo, Erasmus Darwin\'s habits of thought anticipated one of the most distinguishing charaeteristics of his grandson.

On the other hand, Hume failed to achieve positive recognition for his philosophical views. It was Hume\'s History of England that played an influential role in public policy debate during the eighteenth century in both Great Britain and in the United States. Hume\'s Hist01Y of England passed through seven editions and was beginning to be perceived as a classic before Hume\'s death. Voltaire, as an historian, considered it "perhaps the best ever written in any lan guage. " Gibbon greatly admired Hume\'s work and said, of a letter written by Hume in 1776 praising the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, that a compliment from Hume "overpaid the labor of ten years. " After Hume\'s death on August 20, 1776, the History became a factor in the revolutionary events that began to unfold. Louis XVI was a close student of Hume\'s History, and his valet records that, upon having learned that the Convention had voted the death penalty, the King asked for the volume in Hume\'s History covering the trial and execution of Charles I to read in the days that remained.

It is, therefore, not surprising that, in the tradition of western philosophy, the past 200 years or so record an animated discussion of it. In the present collection the debate is continued by representatives of various "schools" in contemporary western thought. A number of philosophers from non-western cultures, too, enter into it. The contributions do not all reflect on the same theme, nor do they use the same approach. Essays written by philosophers sympathetic to the analytical tradition are followed by reflections on the part of those inspired by phe nomenology. A third group of contributions is by non-western thinkers, who are more likely to approach the problem in terms of culture. Their engage ment with the issue clearly shows, among other things, that it is almost exclusively in the western tradition that the fact-value distinction is often understood as an outright dichotomy. The occasion for the publication of this collection is Dr. Cornelis Anthonie van Peursen\'s retirement as Professor of Philosophy. This year he leaves the Free University, Amsterdam; until 1982 he was professor at the University of Leyden as well. In the Netherlands and beyond he has become known for his concern with constructive comparison of diverging philosophical trends and the cross-cultural fertilization of thought.

This work may be seen as representing an answer to such attempts, as they are made, for instance, by the advocates of linguistic analysis or by representatives of the so-called Frankfurt School respectively. By an analysis of Western thought in general with emphasis on the present, the author of this book seeks to show that the abdication of philosophy as critical, reflective theory leads to the abdication of man as a critical, reflective individual, one that is free to dissent and to say No to the system. Man is perverted and alienated from his true nature. He is forced to conform and to lead an "unauthentic existence" within the system.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9789401016087', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=EMTHBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=EMTHBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '9401016089', 'pageCount': 168, 'authors': ['G.A.

Various literary movements arose and existed side by side, while new trends made themselves felt. At no other time in the history of Russian literature was there a similar influx of widely disparate literary and intellectual influences from the West. The complex evolution of literature is reflected in the area of literary classification. Period terms have been used in great variety, yet without general agreement as to the extent, or even the nature of the trends described. The essays of this study are devoted to two major literary trends of the 18th and early 19th century, -sentimentalism and preromanticism. They aim to elucidate their evolu tion as well as at defining and describing the conceptual framework on which they rest. Since the 18th century did not draw a sharp line between translated and original literature, both have been included here. Literary, philosophical, and general cultural influences from the West were of consi derable importance for Russian literature. The concepts, motifs and themes which reached Russian writers in translations moulded their own original works. The 18th century witnessed the formation of an adequate literary language which culminated in Kararnzin's style. The distinction of two stages in the development of sentimentalism as suggested here and the differentiation between both of them and a third literary trend, preroman ticism, is an attempt to reflect adequately the rapid change in stylistic and poetic norms.", 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9789401019880', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=EuQRBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=EuQRBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '9401019886', 'pageCount': 250, 'authors': ['R.

Clima tologists often use the mean (conventionally the monthly and annual mean) of weather-related parameters to describe climate. The mean value, however, is not all the climate. Climatic changes might occur if certain aspects of the distribution of extreme values change, while the mean does not. Katz and Brown (1992), for example, show from a theoretical viewpoint that in a changing climate, extreme values are determined more by changes in variability than changes in the mean. Possible changes in extreme event frequency receive considerable attention along with the global warming, because extremes directly impact human society and the economy. For most societally sensitive extremes and related changes in their vari ability, an analysis based on daily data becomes necessary. This paper considers two aspects (relative and absolute values) of extreme temperatures on a daily basis. We do not consider spells of extreme days, periods which will likely have greater socio-economic and health impacts (Kalkstein et al., 1996; Wagner, 1999), than individual extreme days.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9789401003711', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Yn2hBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Yn2hBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '9401003718', 'pageCount': 392, 'authors': ['Dario Camuffo', 'Phil D.

One can scarcely go more than a few weeks in any large metropolitan area without reading about one of the community\'s upstanding citizens discovered to have been sexually involved with children or adolescents. The attention that the popular media give this topic is paralleled by the attention that it receives in the social sciences, where literally dozens of books and more than a thousand articles have been published on it in the past few years. In fact, "child sexual abuse," along with "co-dependency" and "dysfunctional family," have become the avant-garde psychological cliches of the decade.

In terms of sheer numbers, most of the value concepts of our language are to be found in the area of human relations and of the aesthetic. There are also other value vocabularies, shorter but equally important, for example, the cognitive and logical. These and other objects of pbilosopbical study (for example, the question of "other minds") deserve the kind of empirical survey that has been made of moral and aesthetic notions, if only to test a priori approaches to them. In the present studyan even more determined empirical approach than that adopted for the first has been found necessary. Once the moral or human value vocabulary has been identified, sentential contexts for the use of the terms readily come to mind. In a study of the language of criticism, however, the vocabulary has first to be sought in the utterances of critics themselves and quoted in sufficient context to make their critical intentions clear.

It is not simply that he has produced a large body of outstanding work, in many different areas of philosophy. Or that he combines to an unusual degree rigorous standards with a very wide perspective. Or even that in his path-breaking accounts of algebra, of !)escartes, of Kant and of Russell, he showed in new and profound ways how the histories of science and philosophy could be used to illuminate each other. It is also that he has pursued the application of formal techniques and the defense of liberal institutions with a rare singlemindedness and courage. In a time and place where the former were generally ignored and the latter often attacked, he carried on, at some personal cost, embodying a traditional and ideal conception of the philosophical life, bridging national differences. Those who know him also treasure his friendship. Always curious, he delights in new facts and new experiences, and continually heightens the perception of those around him. Almost yearly, at the College de France he introduced brand new courses always with fresh and fruitful inSights. Exceptionally solicitous, he follows the lives of the families around him in great detail. The devotion of his students is legend. His personal energy is also legend.

Essentially, 20th century East Asia is re-written into the past, as though China and Japan was always the core of East Asian development. This is not at all how East Asia developed. Chinese prehistoric cultures became historic in the 18th century B.C.! Japan was not part of East Asia for over 2300 more years. By studying periods of Chinese unity and disunity, and their effects on China s neighbors, Korea and Vietnam, a distinct culture zone, East Asia, gradually emerged, and slowly included Japan. The main elements of East Asia cultural, social, political, philosophical, religious and linguistic were derived from China, but the others were not minor replicas of China. Each was unique: its people ethnically distinct, from China and each other; its native language, and linguistic blend with Chinese, also unique. Korea and Vietnam resisted Chinese colonization, but adopted and adapted advance Chinese elements to their own needs. Emerging later, Japan underwent wholesale adoption of Tang China s advances, replicated in the 19th century, when Japan was the first East Asian country to modernize. Spanning some thirty-eight centuries, from the 18th century B.C. to 2012 A.D., this diversity with common elements derived from China, is a major theme of this work. It is often overlooked by those who prefer general views, based on surface impressions, to more complex realities. The former often lead to mistakes; the latter become the basis for more sound understanding. After all, these four countries and people share the eastern end of the Eurasian continent, yet each country s geographic situation is also unique. As the twenty-first century continues to unfold, this new approach to East Asia should help to produce clearer and more accurate understanding of this important world region.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9781477265161', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=3Z3a0NU4RHMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=3Z3a0NU4RHMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '1477265163', 'pageCount': 674, 'authors': ['Hugh Dyson Walker'], 'id': '3Z3a0NU4RHMC'}, {'categories': ['Language Arts & Disciplines'], 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=fS4L3ge1K8gC&dq=18th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'publisher': 'Walter de Gruyter', 'subtitle': 'The English Verb-Particle Construction and its History', 'title': 'Phrasal Verbs', 'description': 'This book explores the English verb-particle construction from a historical and cross-linguistic perspective.

Their inquiries revolved around a cluster of issues - the nature of taste, beauty and the sublime, how qualitative differences operate upon the mind through the faculty of taste, and how aesthetic sensibility can be improved through education. This volume brings together and provides contextual introductions to the most significant 18th century writing on the philosophy of art. From the pioneering study of beauty by Francis Hutcheson, through Hume's seminal essays on the standard of taste and tragedy, to the end of the tradition in Dugald Stewart, we are swept up in the debate about art and its value that fascinated the philosophers of enlightenment Scotland - and continues to do so to this day.", 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9781845404444', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=7qC7BAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=7qC7BAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '1845404440', 'pageCount': 249, 'authors': ['Jonathan Friday'], 'id': '7qC7BAAAQBAJ'}, {'categories': ['Social Science'], 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=5df5SVZgBBkC&dq=18th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'publisher': 'Routledge', 'subtitle': 'Culture and Society', 'title': '18th Century Japan', 'description': "The period of Japanese history before the advent of industrialisation and modernism is of tremendous interest.

"Keowee Valley is a terrific first novel by Katherine Scott Crawford--a name that should be remembered. She has a lovely prose style, a great sense of both humor and history, and she tells about a time in South Carolina that I never even imagined." --Pat Conroy, bestselling author of The Prince of Tides and South of Broad. She journeyed into the wilderness to find a kidnapped relative. She stayed to build a new life filled with adventure, danger, and passion. Spring, 1768. The Southern frontier is a treacherous wilderness inhabited by the powerful Cherokee people. In Charlestown, South Carolina, twenty-five-year-old Quincy MacFadden receives news from beyond the grave: her cousin, a man she\'d believed long dead, is alive--held captive by the Shawnee Indians. Unmarried, bookish, and plagued by visions of the future, Quinn is a woman out of place . . . and this is the opportunity for which she\'s been longing. Determined to save two lives, her cousin\'s and her own, Quinn travels the rugged Cherokee Path into the South Carolina Blue Ridge. But in order to rescue her cousin, Quinn must trust an enigmatic half-Cherokee tracker whose loyalties may lie elsewhere. As translator to the British army, Jack Wolf walks a perilous line between a King he hates and a homeland he loves. When Jack is ordered to negotiate for Indian loyalty in the Revolution to come, the pair must decide: obey the Crown, or commit treason . . . Katherine Scott Crawford was born and raised in the blue hills of the South Carolina Upcountry, the history and setting of which inspired Keowee Valley. Winner of a North Carolina Arts Award, she is a former newspaper reporter and outdoor educator, a college English teacher, and an avid hiker. She lives with her family in the mountains of Western North Carolina, where she tries to resist the siren call of her passport as she works on her next novel.

Obsessed by eternity, he neglected history and let himself be carried by legend." Wiesel is talking about the Baal Shem Tov, The Master of the Good Name. Readers acquainted with Jewish history will have an idea who the Baal Shem Tov was. But the width of the spectrum of such ideas can be immeasurably wide. Equally wide is the range of emotions these ideas arouse. Readers unacquainted with such a history may be able to read this book more easily as a novel, which it is. What surrounds the stage of our action is, of course, the great world of history and a time of disruptions and new thinking. Of great consequence is the transmission from China of the musical theory of equal temperament which forms the basis of almost all musical composition from the mid–18th century to the music saturated present. This musical theory was received and then published in France by Mersenne in 1636; in 1722 it was being championed by Bach in his instructions to young musicians collected under the title, The Well Tempered Clavier. That year the Baal Shem Tov was probably earning his living digging clay and accompanying his labors with Carpathian shepherd\'s tunes. The story is told through the eyes of an invented student of his who becomes a physician in Prague.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9781466956346', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=4ZIU3BBLjiUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=4ZIU3BBLjiUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '1466956348', 'pageCount': 218, 'authors': ['Reina Menken', 'Reina And John Menken'], 'id': '4ZIU3BBLjiUC'}, {'categories': ['Business & Economics'], 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=A8yK3zLqARAC&dq=18th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'publisher': 'Gower Publishing, Ltd.', 'subtitle': 'Chinese Culture versus Western Markets', 'title': 'Finance and Society in 21st Century China', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9781409459972', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=A8yK3zLqARAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=A8yK3zLqARAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '1409459977', 'pageCount': 234, 'authors': ['Dr Junie T Tong'], 'id': 'A8yK3zLqARAC'}, {'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'categories': ['Biography & Autobiography'], 'authors': ['John Rossi'], 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=oV5noACeIAkC&dq=18th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'ISBN_13': '9781938178467', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=oV5noACeIAkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=oV5noACeIAkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '1938178467', 'publisher': '5th Corner Publishing', 'subtitle': 'The Real-Life Adventures of an American Veterinarian', 'title': 'All Things Cold and Slimy', 'id': 'oV5noACeIAkC'}, {'categories': ['History'], 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=QXudJGgrUv8C&dq=18th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'publisher': 'McFarland', 'subtitle': 'South Carolina Patriot in the Revolutionary War', 'title': 'Andrew Pickens', 'description': 'Brigadier General Andrew Pickens was a primary force bringing about the end of British control in the Southern colonies.

Increasingly this form of evidence is becoming more important in forensic investigation and yet there are few trained botanists able to assist in such cases. This book is intended to show how useful simple collection methods and standard plant analysis can be in the course of such investigations and is written in a clear and accessible manner to enhance understanding of the subject for the non-specialist. Clearly structured throughout, this book combines well known collection techniques in a field oriented format that can be used for casework. Collection of evidence differs from formal plant collection in that most professional plant collectors are gathering entire plants or significant portions of a plant for permanent storage and reference. Evidence frequently consists of fragments, sometimes exceedingly tiny. Exemplars (examples of reference plants) are collections of plants made in the manner a botanist would collect them. These collections are necessary to link or exclude evidence to or from a scene. Various methods that allow easy collection, transportation, and preservation of evidence are detailed throughout the book. This book is written for those who have no formal background working with plants. It can be used as a practical guide for students taking forensic science courses, law enforcement training, legal courses, and as a template for plant collection at any scene where plants occur and where rules or laws are involved. Veterinarians, various environmental agencies, anthropologists, and archeologists are examples of disciplines that are more recently in need of plant evidence. Veterinarians are becoming more active in pursuing cases of animals that have been abused or are victims of illegal killing. Anthropologists and archeologists are often called to help with body recovery in outdoor environments. Environmental agencies are increasingly forced to adopt rules for resource protection, are in need of a guide for procedures for plant evidence collection and application. The format of the book is designed to present the reader with all the information needed to conduct a botanical analysis of a crime scene; to highlight the forensic significance of the botanical evidence that may be present; how to collect that evidence in the correct manner and preserve and store that evidence appropriately- also shows how to conduct a laboratory analysis of the plants.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9780470664094', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=zx4Xpe3LFNkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=zx4Xpe3LFNkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '0470664096', 'pageCount': 216, 'authors': ['David W.

Intelligent Planning: Discover all of the essential, up-to-date travel insights you expect in a Fodor’s guide, including Fodor’s Choice dining and lodging, top experiences and attractions, and detailed planning advice. Easy Navigation for E-Readers: Whether you’re reading this ebook from start to finish or jumping from chapter to chapter as you develop your itinerary, Fodor’s makes it easy to find the information you need with a single touch. In addition to a traditional main table of contents for the ebook, each chapter opens with its own table of contents, making it easy to browse. Full-Color Photos and Maps: It’s hard not to fall in love with France as you flip through a vivid full-color photo album. Explore the layout of city centers and popular neighborhoods with easy-to-read full-color maps. Plus get an overview of French geography with the convenient atlas at the end of the ebook. What’s Covered? Get to Know France: The Ile-de-France region is the nation’s heartland. Here Louis XIV built vainglorious Versailles, Chartres brings the faithful to their knees, and Monet’s Giverny enchants all. To the south, the Loire Valley offers a parade of royal and near-royal chateaus that magnificently capture France’s golden age of monarchy. Northwest Normandy is sculpted with cliff-lined coasts and a dramatic past marked by Mont-St-Michel’s majestic abbey, Rouen’s towering cathedral, and the D-Day beaches. Brittany, a long arm of rocky land stretching into the Atlantic, is a place unto itself with its own language and time-defying towns such as Gauguin’s Pont-Aven and the pirate haven of St-Malo. The region of Alsace-Lorraine may look and sound German, but its main sights---18th-century Nancy, medieval Strasbourg, and the lovely Route du Vine---remain proudly French. For those travelers looking to imbibe, trips to Champagne Country, the capital of bubbly, or Burgundy, whose vineyards are among the world’s best, cannot be missed. Lyon is France’s natural hub where you can ski Mont Blanc or take a heady trip along the Beaujolais Wine Road. Don’t forget Provence, famed for its Lavender Route, the honey-gold hill towns of Luberon, and vibrant cities. The pebble beaches and zillion-dollar houses of the French Riviera have always captivated sun lovers and socialites from amorous St-Tropez and beauteous Antibes, to sophisticated Nice. The southwestern region, The Midi-Pyrenees is less glamorous than the Riviera and Provence but has an array of must-sees including the “pink city” of Toulouse and fairy-tale Carcassonne. The Dordogne is a stone-cottage pastoral studded with fairy-tale castles, storybook villages, and France’s top prehistoric sights. You’ll fall under Basque Country’s spell with Bay of Biscay resorts like Biarritz, coastal villages such as St-Jean-De-Luz, or the Pyrenean peaks. Relax by sampling the wines of Bordeaux, the standard against which others are measured. They've made the city rich and the owners of its vineyards even richer. No trip to France would be complete without a stop in Paris. A quayside vista that takes in the Seine, a passing boat, Notre-Dame, the Eiffel tower, and mansard roofs all in one generous sweep is enough to convince you that this is indeed the most beautiful city on Earth.

Finding inspiration and value in 18th-century plants, tools, and techniques, the gardeners at Colonial Williamsburg have discovered that these traditional vegetable-growing methods are perfectly at home in today\'s modern organic gardens. After all, in the 18th century, organic gardening was the only type of gardening and local produce the only produce available. Author Wesley Greene founded the Colonial Garden in Colonial Williamsburg\'s Historic Area in 1996. He and his colleagues have painstakingly researched the ways the colonists planted and tended their vegetable and herb beds, most of which are more relevant than ever. Along with historical commentary and complete growing instructions for 50 delicious vegetables, including colonial varieties still available today, gardeners and folklorists will find weather-watching guidelines, planting techniques, and seedsaving advice for legumes, brassicas, alliums, root crops, nightshades, melons, squash, greens, and other curious and tender produce.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9781609611637', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=RRQ9AQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=RRQ9AQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '1609611632', 'pageCount': 256, 'authors': ['Wesley Greene'], 'id': 'RRQ9AQAAQBAJ'}, {'categories': ['Gardening'], 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=KFQMt1Ww6osC&dq=18th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'averageRating': 4.5, 'publisher': 'Rodale', 'subtitle': "18th-Century Methods for Today's Organic Gardeners", 'title': 'Vegetable Gardening the Colonial Williamsburg Way', 'description': 'A Colonial Williamsburg garden historian outlines traditional methods for planting and tending 50 different kinds of vegetables, profiling such 18th-century utilities as shelter paper and fermented manure while sharing complementary weather-watching guidelines, organic techniques and seed-saving advice.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9781609611620', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=KFQMt1Ww6osC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=KFQMt1Ww6osC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '1609611624', 'pageCount': 256, 'authors': ['Wesley Greene'], 'id': 'KFQMt1Ww6osC'}, {'categories': ['History'], 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=1NFJBW66IDgC&dq=18th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'publisher': 'ABC-CLIO', 'subtitle': 'Conflict, Revolution, and Change', 'title': 'The Middle East in Turmoil', 'description': "Since the end of the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s, conflict in the Middle East has been increasingly wrought with internal struggles, driven by ethnic, inter-communal, and religious differences.

It has profoundly influenced the literatures of Ottoman Turkey, Muslim India and Turkic Central Asia. It has been a source of inspiration for Goethe, Emerson, Matthew Arnold and Jorge Luis Borges among others, and praised by William Jones, Tagore, E.M. Forster and many more. Yet Persian literature has never received the attention it merits. Whereas Persian art and architecture, and more recently Iranian cinema, have been written about extensively and at different levels for a varied audience, Persian literature - the greatest achievement of the Iranian people, and one of the major literatures of the world - has largely remained the exclusive domain of specialists. And although in the past few years the poems of Rumi have attracted the kind of popular attention enjoyed by Omar Khayyam’s quatrains in the 19th century, Persian literature has never received the attention it truly deserves._x000D_ _x000D_ A History of Persian Literature responds to this need and offers a new, comprehensive and detailed history of its subject. This 18-volume, authoritative survey reflects the stature and significance of Persian literature as the single most important accomplishment of the Iranian nation. Prominent scholars in the field bring a fresh critical approach to bear on this important topic and each volume includes representative samples of this literature._x000D_ _x000D_ In this volume the Editors offer an indispensable overview of the long and rich tradition of historical writing as a literary form in Persian. Highlighting the central themes and ideas which inform Persian historiography - such as the ethical and exemplary value of history, and its role in legitimising political power - this book traces the development of Persian historical writing from its origins in the 10th century and its evolution under the Mongols and Safavids, through the twilight of the traditional chronicle in the late 18th century. It goes on to trace the emergence of a national historiography during the 19th century and into the Pahlavi Era. This volume also offers an account of parallel developments in histories written in Persian in Ottoman Turkey, Central Asia and Afghanistan, reflecting the vitality of Persian culture throughout the region and the persistence of literary models and repeated themes over the centuries. The first work of its kind to consider the whole course of traditional and modern historical writing in Iran, Persian Historiography provides a much-needed introduction to the subject and serves as an essential guide to this important strand of Persian literary production.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9780857721402', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=A2QBAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=A2QBAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '0857721402', 'pageCount': 400, 'authors': ['Ehsan Yarshater', 'Charles Melville'], 'id': 'A2QBAwAAQBAJ'}, {'categories': ['History'], 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=Sa_lM3aEgrIC&dq=18th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'publisher': 'Osprey Publishing', 'title': 'Tomahawk and Musket - French and Indian Raids in the Ohio Valley 1758', 'description': 'In 1758, at the height of the French and Indian War, British Brigadier General John Forbes led his army on a methodical advance against Fort Duquesene, French headquarters in the Ohio valley. As his army closed in upon the fort, he sent Major Grant of the 77th Highlanders and 850 men on a reconnaissance in force against the fort. The French, alerted to this move, launched their own counter-raid. 500 French and Canadians, backed by 500 Indian allies, ambushed the highlanders and sent them fleeing back to the main army. With the success of that operation, the French planed their own raid against the English encampment at Fort Ligonier under less than fifty miles away. With only 600 men, against an enemy strength of 4,000, he ordered a daring night attack on the heart of the enemy encampment.

Development thinking is inherently tied to the quest for sustainable growth strategies. This book provides a neoclassical approach for studying the determinants of economic structure and its transformation and draws new insights for development policy. The market is the basic mechanism for effective resource allocation at each level of development. However, economic development as a dynamic process entails structural changes, including industrial upgrading and diversification and corresponding improvements in hard and soft infrastructure. Such upgrading and improvements require coordination and go hand in hand with large externalities to firms' transaction costs and returns to capital investment. Thus, in addition to an effective market mechanism, the government should play an active role in facilitating structural changes.

It outlines a process of analyzing works in the Classical tradition by uncovering the construction of a piece of music—the formal, harmonic, rhythmic, and voice-leading organizations—as well as its unique features. It develops an in-depth approach that is applied to works by composers including Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven, Schubert, Schumann, and Brahms. The book begins with foundational chapters in music theory, starting with basic diatonic harmony and progressing rapidly to more advanced topics, such as phrase design, phrase expansion, and chromatic harmony. The second part contains analyses of complete musical works and movements. The text features over 150 musical examples, including numerous complete annotated scores. Suggested assignments at the end of each chapter guide students in their own musical analysis.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9780415806657', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=hR8MbB-D9DoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=hR8MbB-D9DoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '0415806658', 'pageCount': 368, 'authors': ['David Beach', 'Ryan C.

It assesses the ways in which meanings of physical difference were formed within different cultural contexts, and examines how disabled men and women used, appropriated, or rejected these representations in making sense of their own experiences. In the process, it asks a series of related questions: what constituted 'disability' in eighteenth-century culture and society? How was impairment perceived? How did people with disabilities see themselves and relate to others? What do their stories tell us about the social and cultural contexts of disability, and in what ways were these narratives and experiences shaped by class and gender? In order to answer these questions, the book explores the languages of disability, the relationship between religious and medical discourses of disability, and analyzes depictions of people with disabilities in popular culture, art, and the media. It also uncovers the 'hidden histories' of disabled men and women themselves drawing on elite letters and autobiographies, Poor Law documents and criminal court records.", 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9780415886444', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=P8psv_e6ucMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=P8psv_e6ucMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '0415886449', 'pageCount': 213, 'authors': ['David M.

The Iberian Peninsula served as a springboard for Muslim expansion into Christian Europe, and, within Christendom, the reaction was aggressive religious fanaticism. There was also a contrasting spirit (a trend toward tolerance in the Spanish experience), with the "Golden Age" of Muslim rule in Spain, which was able to develop due to the country\'s distance from centers of Islam. This book surveys the evolution of the Spanish Empire in the aftermath of the Reconquista and portrays the dire economic consequences it wrought when extremism and aggressive religious fanaticism that eschewed enlightenment became a dominant force in Spain. The Spanish Civil War was the factor that eventually gave rise to Spanish unity and the emergence of a Spanish national identity, previously unattainable. This change of attitudes and values benefited the economy, as well as society. Religious tolerance, only reintroduced after Franco\'s rule, has had a similar beneficial effect. The Spanish experience - in successfully integrating Spain\'s disparate parts in the wake of its civil war - can serve as a model for an overarching European identity. This book is part of the series Heritage, Society and National Identity in the European Union, which sets out the historical national and religious characteristics of the Germans, French, Italians, Spanish, Dutch, and British, as they impact the integration of the respective groups within the European Union.

There are, however, a number of societies who dissent from this orthodoxy, either in general or on particular issues, on the basis of political necessity, cultural tradition, or group interest. Human Rights in World History takes a global historical perspective to examine the emergence of this dilemma and its constituent concepts. Beginning with premodern features compatible with a human rights approach, including religious doctrines and natural rights ideas, it goes on to describe the rise of the first modern-style human rights statements, associated with the Enlightenment and contemporary antislavery and revolutionary fervor. Along the way, it explores ongoing contrasts in the liberal approach, between sincere commitments to human rights and a recurrent sense that certain types of people had to be denied common rights because of their perceived backwardness and need to be "civilized". These contrasts find clear echo in later years with the contradictions between the pursuit of human rights goals and the spread of Western imperialism. By the second half of the 20th century, human rights frameworks had become absorbed into key global institutions and conventions, and their arguments had expanded to embrace multiple new causes. In today\'s postcolonial world, and with the rise of more powerful regional governments, the tension between universal human rights arguments and local opposition or backlash is more clearly delineated than ever but no closer to satisfactory resolution.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9780415507950', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=iMfe5nRRzNwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=iMfe5nRRzNwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '0415507952', 'pageCount': 196, 'authors': ['Peter N.

Global food production is a major contributor to global greenhouse gas emissions and at the same time it is among the sectors worst affected by climate change. This book brings together a multidisciplinary group of authors exploring the ethical dimensions of climate change and food. Conceptual clarifications provide a necessary basis for putting sustainable development into practice. Adaptation and mitigation demand altering both agricultural and consumption practices. Intensive vs. extensive production is reassessed with regard to animal welfare, efficiency and environmental implications. Property rights pay an ever-increasing role, as do shifting land-use practices, agro-energy, biotechnology, food policy to green consumerism. And, last but not least, tools are suggested for teaching agricultural and food ethics. Notwithstanding the plurality of ethical analyses and their outcome, it becomes apparent that governance of agri-food is faced by new needs and new approaches of bringing in the value dimension much more explicitly. This book is intended to serve as a stimulating collection that will contribute to debate and reflection on the sustainable future of agriculture and food production in the face of global change.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9789086867530', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=kha0N2yg3RMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=kha0N2yg3RMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '9086867537', 'pageCount': 526, 'authors': ['European Society for Agricultural and Food Ethics.

Missionaries were in the forefront of this encounter: in order to speak to potential converts, they needed to learn local languages. A great wealth of missionary grammars survives from the 16th century onwards. Some of these are precious records of the languages they document, and all of them witness their authors’ attempts to develop the methods of grammatical description with which they were familiar, to accommodate dramatically new linguistic features.This book is the first monograph covering the whole Portuguese grammatical tradition outside Portugal. Its aim is to provide an integrated description, analysis and evaluation of the missionary grammars which were written in Portuguese. Between them, these grammars covered a huge range of languages: in Asia, Tamil, four Indo-Aryan languages and Japanese; in Brazil, Kipeá and Tupinambá; in Africa and the African diaspora, Kimbundu and Sena (from the modern Angola and Mozambique respectively).Each text is placed in its historical context, and its linguistic context is analyzed, with particular attention to orthography, the parts of speech system, morphology and syntax. Whenever possible, pedagogical features of the grammars are discussed, together with their treatment of language variation and pragmatics, and the evidence they provide for the missionaries’ attitude towards the languages they studied.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9789027283252', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=zaNxAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=zaNxAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '9027283257', 'pageCount': 359, 'authors': ['Otto Zwartjes'], 'id': 'zaNxAAAAQBAJ'}, {'categories': ['Political Science'], 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=y-Kj8-ppeD8C&dq=18th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'publisher': 'Columbia University Press', 'subtitle': 'Enlightenment Origins of the Political', 'title': 'States of War', 'description': "We fear that the growing threat of violent attack, whether from terrorism or other sources, has upset the balance between existential concepts of political power, which emphasize security, and traditional notions of constitutional limits meant to protect civil liberties. We worry that constitutional states cannot, during a time of war, terror, and extreme crisis, maintain legality and preserve civil rights and freedoms. David W. Bates allays these concerns by revisiting the theoretical origins of the modern constitutional state, which, he argues, recognized and made room for tensions among law, war, and the social order. We traditionally associate the Enlightenment with the taming of absolutist sovereign power through the establishment of a legal state based on the rights of individuals. In his critical rereading, Bates shows instead that Enlightenment thinkers conceived of political autonomy in a systematic, theoretical way. Focusing on the nature of foundational violence, war, and existential crises, eighteenth-century thinkers understood law and constitutional order not as a constraint on political power but as the logical implication of that primordial force. Returning to the origin stories that informed the beginnings of political community, Bates reclaims the idea of law, warfare, and the social order as intertwining elements subject to complex historical development. Following an analysis of seminal works by seventeenth-century natural-law theorists, Bates reviews the major canonical thinkers of constitutional theory (Locke, Montesquieu, and Rousseau) from the perspective of existential security and sovereign power. Countering Carl Schmitt's influential notion of the autonomy of the political, Bates demonstrates that Enlightenment thinkers understood the autonomous political sphere as a space of law protecting individuals according to their political status, not as mere members of a historically contingent social order.", 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9780231528665', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=y-Kj8-ppeD8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=y-Kj8-ppeD8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '0231528663', 'pageCount': 272, 'authors': ['David Bates'], 'id': 'y-Kj8-ppeD8C'}, {'categories': ['History'], 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=JmdLQcedFKkC&dq=18th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'publisher': 'Osprey Publishing', 'title': 'The Spanish Army in North America 1700-1793', 'description': 'Long before England established a serious presence in the New World, Spain had already established an overseas Empire.

Its author, a Georgian doctor produced this examination of 18th century medicine at the same time as publishing an extremely controversial book on infection. Alexander Gordon had proved conclusively that puerperal (child-bed) fever was passed between patients by midwives. The idea met with outrage and hostility and saw him forced to leave his native city of Aberdeen, leaving behind hundreds of carefully penned pages of The Practise of Physick, a near-complete general text of medicine. Incredibly the final page of the original script even stops in mid-sentence as if the writer had fled there and then. Gordon’s remarkable unseen work has lain practically untouched ever since. Now painstakingly reworked by Doctor Peter Bennett, himself a medical author of international reputation, it gives a vivid account of medicine in the late 18th century. It was a time of enormous change; the industrial revolution was getting underway, and we were deep in the period of the Enlightenment. The medical profession was alive with new and unsubstantiated theory. Medical dogma that had held sway for two millennia was being challenged but the discoveries of the 19th century were but a speck on the horizon. In the 1790’s doctors were still cupping, bleeding and leeching. Medications often contained the highly toxic mercury; Tar Water enjoyed a completely unjustified reputation as a universal remedy; effective drugs were prescribed indiscriminately. The book helps to explain the thinking behind practices which we would now regard as mystifying but were thought of as entirely rational at the time. Gordon's words provide a graphic and colourful account of life as a physician [and as a patient] two centuries ago. Arguably he lost his rightful place alongside the luminaries of medical history. Perhaps the book you hold in your hand will do something finally to redress the balance.", 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9781467892575', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=jFa3cCiE0v8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=jFa3cCiE0v8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '1467892572', 'pageCount': 416, 'authors': ['Peter Bennett'], 'id': 'jFa3cCiE0v8C'}, {'categories': ['Travel'], 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=t0OtrmXuNaUC&dq=18th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'publisher': 'Fodors Travel Publications', 'title': "Fodor's 2012 France", 'description': "Full-color guide • Make your trip to France unforgettable with 75 maps, illustrated features, and 330 color photos.

The legal systems of many countries around the world have been influenced by the principles of the Enlightenment: freedom, equality and fraternity. The position is similar in relation to the accompanying state ideal of the democratic constitutional state as well as the notion of a welfare state. The foundation of these principles lies in the ideal of individual autonomy. The law must in this view guarantee a social order which secures the equal freedom of all. This freedom is moreover fundamental because in modern pluralistic societies a great diversity of views exist concerning the appropriate way of life. This freedom ideal is however also strongly contested.

Information Age Tales recaps the history of speech, languages, writing, and memory and describes how these revolutions paved the way for today’s age of cyberspace.

Bradford presents an information technology trail that includes concepts such as the following: • Water monkeys may have been our ancestors. • Fearsome Mongol warriors played a positive role in the rise of Western Civilization. • Hindus in India and the Arabs unveiled long-hidden numerical tools needed for modern science to emerge in the West. • Interchangeable parts appear more than four centuries before Eli Whitney won his historic patent to manufacture muskets with them.

It is a word with which we are universally familiar, and a condition that haunts the human imagination. Through the centuries, in poetry and in prose, in drama and in the visual arts, its depredations are on display for all to see. A whole industry has grown up, devoted to its management and suppression. Madness profoundly disturbs our common sense assumptions; threatens the social order, both symbolically and practically; creates almost unbearable disruptions in the texture of daily living; and turns our experience and our expectations upside down. Lunacy, insanity, psychosis, mental illness - whatever term we prefer, its referents are disturbances of reason, the passions, and human action that frighten, create chaos, and yet sometimes amuse; that mark a gulf between the common sense reality most of us embrace, and the discordant version some humans appear to experience. Social responses to madness, our interpretations of what madness is, and our notions of what is to be done about it have varied remarkably over the centuries. In this Very Short Introduction, Andrew Scull provides a provocative and entertaining examination of the social, cultural, medical, and artistic responses to mental disturbance across more than two millennia, concluding with some observations on the contemporary accounts of mental illness. ABOUT THE SERIES: The Very Short Introductions series from Oxford University Press contains hundreds of titles in almost every subject area.

The goal: establishing the actual practice in the Age of Enlightenment, and explaining why this was the case. The ideology of the Age was that law, i.e., the will of the sovereign, can be explicitly and appropriately stated, thus making interpretation redundant. However, the reality was that in the 18th century, there was no one leading source of national law that would be the object of interpretation. Instead, there was a plurality of sources of law: the Roman Law, local customary law, and the royal ordinance. However, in deciding a case in a court of law, the law must speak with one voice. Hence, interpretation to unify the norms was inevitable. What was the process? What role did justification in terms of reason, the hallmark of the Enlightenment, play?

Romanticism is largely an intellectual movement that grew out of the lingering effects of the revolt against aristocratic rule that begin with the French Revolution. It includes the works of such greats as Jacques-Louis David, Frederic Edwin Church, Eugène Delacroix, Winslow Homer, Victor Hugo, Francisco Goya, Thomas Cole, and William Blake. The Historical Dictionary of Romantic Art and Architecture provides an overview of Romanticism, focusing on its major artists, architects, stylistic subcategories, ideas, and historical framework of the late 18th century style.

In Building a Bridge to the Eighteenth Century he revisits the Enlightenment, that great flowering of ideas that provided a humane direction for the future -- ideas that formed our nation and that we would do well to embrace anew. He turns our attention to Goethe, Voltaire, Rousseau, Diderot, Kant, Edward Gibbon, Adam Smith, Thomas Paine, Jefferson, and Franklin, and to their then-radical thinking about inductive science, religious and political freedom, popular education, rational commerce, the nation-state, progress, and happiness. Postman calls for a future connected to traditions that provide sane authority and meaningful purpose -- as opposed to an overreliance on technology and an increasing disregard for the lessons of history. And he argues passionately for specific new guidelines in the education of our children, with renewed emphasis on developing the intellect as successfully as we are developing a computer-driven world. Witty, provocative, and brilliantly reasoned, Building a Bridge to the Eighteenth Century is Neil Postman\'s most radical, and most commonsensical, book yet.

The problematic that arises in what American presidents Clinton and Obama have repeatedly called a "one-nation one-state" political system is: how will the state assure and protect the unique needs and interests of its minorities, particularly its historically oppressed national minorities? All black officials in the United States government are in the same position as the president; they are required to represent first of all the majority\'s interests. For a national minority to be able to fully address its special needs (when it can find no specific representation in the majority-dominated platform of either political party or the policy agenda of government), it must seek to enjoy the full range of human and civil rights, particularly the right to self-determination. Hajji Malik Al-Shabazz understood that the African Americans were still in the grip of American domestic colonialism. He feared that the majority ethny would prefer to commit the violation of forced assimilation leading possibly to ethnocide rather than to negotiate collective equal-status integration with the African American national minority. As the presidency of Barack Obama is demonstrating, electing a Black president who is required to address the state\'s interest as a whole is not the answer for improving the well being of African Americans.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9780932863973', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=QF_Kabh4wVsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=QF_Kabh4wVsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '0932863973', 'pageCount': 137, 'authors': ['Yussuf Naim Kly'], 'id': 'QF_Kabh4wVsC'}, {'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=na-C689BaE0C&dq=18th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'ISBN_13': '9781847471581', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=na-C689BaE0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=na-C689BaE0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '1847471587', 'pageCount': 170, 'publisher': 'Chipmunkapublishing ltd', 'authors': ['Kevin Rice'], 'title': 'Innocents Abroad', 'description': "DescriptionComing Soon About the AuthorKevin Rice, author of Innocents Abroad, was born in Birmingham in 1947. He was educated at a school in Birmingham, and on leaving school got a job as a computer operator. In this job he learned how to write programmes for a mainframe, such as you had in the 1960's. He left that job after a year, and had a series of jobs. In his 20's he became involved with the psychiatric system. He couldn't get a job, because there was no work, and nobody wanted to employ anybody with a past mental illness. This led to him going into hospital long term. Whilst in hospital, he attended education classes, mostly in science and IT, since his knowledge of computers was now a bit out of date. He also read, and watched TV documentaries, which enabled him to acquire the knowledge necessary to write Innocents abroad. He was in a number of hospitals until 2007, and was then discharged to a half way house, since by now he had almost recovered. He still lives in the half way house today, and wrote Innocents Abroad in a narrative context, hoping to help put mental illness in a more favourable light, so that in the future, nobody will be refused a job because of a past mental illness like he was in his 20's.", 'id': 'na-C689BaE0C'}, {'categories': ['Education'], 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=IO2sAgAAQBAJ&dq=18th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'publisher': 'Routledge', 'subtitle': 'Comparative Visions', 'title': 'Schooling and the Making of Citizens in the Long Nineteenth Century', 'description': 'This book is a comparative history that explores the social, cultural, and political formation of the modern nation through the construction of public schooling. It asks how modern school systems arose in a variety of different republics and non-republics across four continents during the period from the late eighteenth century to the early twentieth century. The authors begin with the republican preoccupation with civic virtue – the need to overcome self-interest in order to take up the common interest – which requires a form of education that can produce individuals who are capable of self-guided rational action for the public good. They then ask how these educational preoccupations led to the emergence of modern school systems in a disparate array of national contexts, even those that were not republican. By examining historical changes in republicanism across time and space, the authors explore central epistemologies that connect the modern individual to community and citizenship through the medium of schooling. Ideas of the individual were reformulated in the nineteenth century in reaction to new ideas about justice, social order, and progress, and the organization and pedagogy of the school turned these changes into a way to transform the self into the citizen.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9781136733468', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=IO2sAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=IO2sAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '1136733469', 'pageCount': 328, 'authors': ['Daniel Tröhler', 'Thomas S.

Reviewing nearly one thousand instances of protest in China from the eighteenth to the early-nineteenth centuries, Ho-fung Hung charts an evolution of Chinese dissent that stands apart from Western trends. Hung samples from mid-Qing petitions and humble plaints to the emperor. He revisits rallies, riots, market strikes, and other forms of contention rarely considered in previous studies. Drawing on new world history, which accommodates parallels and divergences between political-economic and cultural developments East and West, Hung shows how the centralization of political power and an expanding market, coupled with a persistent Confucianist orthodoxy, shaped protesters' strategies and appeals in Qing China. This unique form of mid-Qing protest combined a quest for justice and autonomy with a filial-loyal respect for the imperial center, and Hung's careful research ties this distinct characteristic to popular protest in China today. As Hung makes clear, the nature of these protests prove late imperial China was anything but a stagnant and tranquil empire before the West cracked it open. In fact, the origins of modern popular politics in China predate the 1911 Revolution. Hung's work ultimately establishes a framework others can use to compare popular protest among different cultural fabrics.

(MACAULAY 1790: 32) Eighteenth Century England was a time in which women had little to say in society. They did not have the right to vote, they were not allowed to own properties, when married and as the husband was the chief breadwinner, they were not supposed to work. As they could not leave the house alone without being considered a prostitute, they were confined to the home where they would have to take care of the children and the household, "a subordinate role [...] in society" (AUGUSTIN 2005: 2). As a consequence, as girls did not need to go to school to learn their future tasks as housewives, they were educated at home by their mothers who acted as a role model. The entire eighteenth and well into the nineteenth century there was little change in how girls and women were educated. The old system of patriarchy was still well established but it began to crumble little by little. Women began to fight for their rights getting more and more supporters. This work is trying to shed light on this period\'s progression from girls being educated poorly to girls having the same education as their brothers. The fist chapter is going to show how gender differences were tried to be justified from a psyco-medical point of view, transferring the scientific findings to women\'s roles in society. The second chapter will show how important women were beginning to challenge the old system, disproving the validity of the scientific findings.

Missionaries were in the forefront of this encounter: in order to speak to potential converts, they needed to learn local languages.

Some of these are precious records of the languages they document, and all of them witness their authors' attempts to develop the methods of grammatical description with which they were familiar, to accommodate dramatically new linguistic features.This book is the first monograph covering the whole Portuguese grammatical tradition outside Portugal. Its aim is to provide an integrated description, analysis and evaluation of the missionary grammars which were written in Portuguese. Between them, these grammars covered a huge range of languages: in Asia, Tamil, four Indo-Aryan languages and Japanese; in Brazil, Kipeá and Tupinambá; in Africa and the African diaspora, Kimbundu and Sena (from the modern Angola and Mozambique respectively).Each text is placed in its historical context, and its linguistic context is analyzed, with particular attention to orthography, the parts of speech system, morphology and syntax.

Pocket sized 5" x 7" and with a new foreword by Llewellyn H. Rockwell, Jr. Here is the revolutionary book on monetary reform - brilliant, compelling, clear, with specific reforms to do now - in an edition for global distribution. See the price. And the format is really a pocket edition edition: extremely small format that is super convenient. This edition is specifically designed to be purchased in large quantities. Had the U.S. followed the recommendations of this wonderful report when it came out in 1982, there would have been no housing bubble, no gigantic government debt, no depression, no economic upheaval, no high unemployment, and no international turmoil. This was a window of opportunity for reform. This is proof that Ron was right. In 1982, Ron Paul served on the U.S. Gold Commission to evaluate the role of gold in the monetary system. In fact, the Commission was his idea. It was carrying forth a promise made in the Republican platform. Back then, Republicans at least made noises about favoring a gold standard based on a gold dollar. Ron couldn\'t pick the members, so from the beginning, the deck was stacked. The majority was dominated by monetarists, who saw gold as too scarce and paper as just fine. Ron Paul\'s team was ready, however, with this marvelous minority report. Rarely has a dissent on a government commission done so much good! The result was The Case for Gold, and it was the greatest result of the commission. It covers the history of gold in the United States, explains that its breakdown was caused by governments, and explains the merit of having sound money: prices reflect market realities, government stays in check, and the people retain their freedom. The recommendations include re-establishing a gold standard and a gold dollar in addition to permitting monetary competition and the private production of moneys. The scholarship and rigor impressed even the critics of the minority. Ron and Lewis Lehrman worked with a team of economists that included Murray Rothbard, so it is hardly surprising that such a book would result. It still holds up as an excellent blueprint for moving beyond paper money and into the age of sound money. In particular, Ron favors complete monetary freedom to use any commodity as money, to make contracts in any money, and an end to the monopolization and printing power of the Federal Reserve. There is a strong piece of history in this book. Not since the 19th century has a political figure made such a sweeping and devastating case for radical monetary reform. This congressman ran circles around even the experts at the Fed. A dazzling performance indeed, and an inspiring and learned book. This remains the best possible case for a gold dollar and monetary freedom in print in our times.

The book portrays the history of science and technology as an underlying tension between hubris - literally the ambition to "play god" on the part of many a scientist and engineer and neglect the consequences - and a hybrid imagination, connecting scientific "facts" and technological "artifacts" with cultural understanding.^', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9781608457373', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=tRHrPzn9UqwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=tRHrPzn9UqwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '1608457370', 'pageCount': 164, 'authors': ['Andrew Jamison', 'Steen Hyldgaard Christensen', 'Lars Botin'], 'id': 'tRHrPzn9UqwC'}, {'categories': ['History'], 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=JNLPDNdRqGYC&dq=18th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'publisher': 'Arcadia Publishing', 'title': 'Richland Township and Richlandtown Borough', 'description': "Richland Township, located in historic Bucks County, was settled around 1710 by Welsh Quakers who used European farming methods to turn the swamp into rich farmland.

The first settlement grew around the Richland Friend's Meeting House and was incorporated as Quakertown Borough in 1855. Another village, Richlandtown, was a center of religious and commercial life. Richland Township remained mainly agricultural during the first half of the 20th century, while Richlandtown, incorporated in 1890, continues to be a typical small town.

As a major shaping philosophy of Western culture, it had a historical impact on the religious, cultural, academic, and social institutions of 18th century Europe. In this compelling volume, the author explores the lasting impact of Enlightenment thinking on modern Western societies and other democracies. With an interdisciplinary, comparative-historical approach this volume explores the impact of Enlightenment ideals such as liberty, equality, and social justice on current social institutions. Combining sociological theory with concrete examples, the author provides a unique framework for understanding modern cultural development, including a picture of how it would look without this Enlightenment basis. This work provides a multi-faceted approach, including: an historical overview, analysis of the Enlightenment’s influence on modern democratic societies, modern culture, political science, civil society and the economy, as well as exploring the counter-Enlightenment, Post-Enlightenment, and Neo-Enlightenment philosophies.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9781441973870', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=bR8UyegNBEMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=bR8UyegNBEMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '1441973877', 'pageCount': 367, 'authors': ['Milan Zafirovski'], 'id': 'bR8UyegNBEMC'}, {'categories': ['American newspapers'], 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=2nfuugAACAAJ&dq=18th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'subtitle': 'Press and Public in Eighteenth-century Britain and America', 'title': 'Reading Newspapers', 'description': 'In the 18th century newspapers reached an all-embracing readership: male and female, noble and artisan, in both town and country.

There is a suicide death in India almost every 4 minutes, and it is the leading cause of death for rural Indians especially women in early adulthood. This book presents a comprehensive analysis of suicide in India based on original research as well as existing studies, and looks at the issue in an international, sociological and historical context. The author looks at the reliability of suicide data in India, and goes on to discuss various factors relating to suicide, including age, gender, education and marriage. Among its findings, the book exposes a hidden youth suicide ‘crisis’ in India which is argued to be far more serious than the better known crisis of farmer suicides. The book dispels many myths that are commonly associated with suicide, and highlights a neglected public health problem. Suicide in the region of Pondicherry is looked at in detail, as well as in the Indian Diaspora.

Seth surveys Korean history from Neolithic times to the present. He explores the origins and development of Korean society, politics, and its still little-known cultural heritage from their inception to the two Korean states of today. Telling the remarkable story of the origins and evolution of a society that borrowed and adopted from abroad, Seth describes how various tribal peoples in the peninsula came together to form one of the world's most distinctive communities. He shows how this ancient, culturally and ethnically homogeneous society was wrenched into the world of late-nineteenth-century imperialism, fell victim to Japanese expansionism, and then became arbitrarily divided into two opposed halves, North and South, after World War II. Tracing the past seven decades, the book explains how the two Koreas, with their deeply different political and social systems and geopolitical orientations, evolved into sharply contrasting societies. South Korea, after an unpromising start, became one of the few postcolonial developing states to enter the ranks of the first world, with a globally competitive economy, a democratic political system, and a cosmopolitan and dynamic culture. North Korea, by contrast, became one of the world's most totalitarian and isolated societies, a nuclear power with an impoverished and famine-stricken population. Seth describes and analyzes the radically different and historically unprecedented trajectories of the two Koreas, formerly one tight-knit society. Throughout, he adds a rich dimension by placing Korean history into broader global perspective and by including primary readings from each era. All readers looking for a balanced, knowledgeable history will be richly rewarded with this clear and concise book.", 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9780742567177', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=WJtMGXyGlUEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=WJtMGXyGlUEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '0742567176', 'pageCount': 552, 'authors': ['Michael J.

If one talks about censorship as a type of social control then one is "overstretching" the concept of the word, as there are a wide variety of social control measures. Thus, breeding can be regarded as censorship or God\'s verdict about a forbidden fruit can also be considered as a censorship act. But, since the focal point of this paper is literary censorship, a narrower meaning of the term, such as book censorship, is required. Traditionally, book censorship has been seen as a control over printed expression by authorities, and mostly by the church or government. Alec Craig emphasizes that "it is writing rather than speech that attracts authoritative attention and social pressures because it is so much more enduring and effective; and books have been subject to control of some sort wherever they have been an important medium of communication." The earliest examples of such regulations can already be found in Ancient Rome and Greece, where the works of Ovid and Socrates were suppressed, or in China, where the writings of Confucius were banned and burned by order of the emperor. However, these censorship measures were not of systematical character, and authorities in the ancient world failed to institutionalize this practice of book suppression. Not until the invention of the printing press and a consequential wide spread adoption in the usage of printing books, especially during the Reformation, was it necessary for the authorities to create a system of sharp control of the written word. It is widely known that literature is one of the richest sources that contains the knowledge of social consciousness. It portrays the impression of social norms and values as well as mod', 'id': 'CqaAGfL-IQIC'}, {'categories': ['Literary Criticism'], 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=X-pXRNgY2LwC&dq=18th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'publisher': 'JHU Press', 'subtitle': 'Tragic Responsibility and the Novel Form', 'title': "Harm's Way", 'description': "Macpherson's original insights will have a broad and lasting impact on the study of the 18th-century novel.", 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9780801895951', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=X-pXRNgY2LwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=X-pXRNgY2LwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '0801895952', 'pageCount': 256, 'authors': ['Sandra Macpherson'], 'id': 'X-pXRNgY2LwC'}, {'categories': ['Law'], 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=BGspisNz4TEC&dq=18th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'publisher': 'Cambridge University Press', 'subtitle': 'The First Amendment and the Legacy of English Law', 'title': 'Repressive Jurisprudence in the Early American Republic', 'description': 'This volume seeks to explain how American society, which had been capable of noble aspirations such as those in the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution, was capable of adopting one of the most widely deplored statutes of our history, the Sedition Act of 1798. It examines how the political ideals of the American Revolution were undermined by the adoption of repressive doctrines of the English monarchial system - the criminalization of criticism against the king, the Parliament, the judiciary, and Christianity. Freedom of speech was dramatically confined, and this law remained unchallenged until well into the twentieth century. This book will be of keen interest to all concerned with the early Republic, freedom of speech, and evolution of American constitutional jurisprudence.

Austin’s Texas colony had their roots in a turbulent, distant past. From the early 1600’s, their courageous ancestors had pushed westward, leaving the European shores to carve out a new nation from the wilderness. They fled religious and political oppression in search of a better life in which freedom was of supreme importance. Many came with tales of their former struggles in Londonderry, Ireland during the great siege, of terrible massacres and clan rivalries in the times of William Wallace and Robert the Bruce, King of Scotland. They vividly remembered the tribulations of Martin Luther and the deadly religious split with the Catholic Church. More recently, memories of their parent’s participation in the American Revolution, of dramatic, true life scenes such as depicted in the movie “The Patriot” filled their minds, their fathers having ridden along side of the wily Swamp Fox, Francis Marion. These pioneers associated themselves with men like Travis, Crockett, Houston and Andrew Jackson. Many of these early trailblazers were Scots-Irish and German immigrants. They were on a westward trek to grasp a special prize, to seal America’s Manifest Destiny. And that prize they sought was Texas. From Jamestown to Texas is the story of these intrepid pioneers and their ancestors who cleared and farmed the land, who fought the Indians, battled the elements, and carved out this wonderful country that we have today.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9781453576397', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=D_ktpnNHcbIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=D_ktpnNHcbIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '1453576398', 'pageCount': 680, 'authors': ['Betty Smith Meischen'], 'id': 'D_ktpnNHcbIC'}, {'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'authors': ['Source: Wikia'], 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=V-wBywAACAAJ&dq=18th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'ISBN_13': '9781234710163', 'ISBN_10': '1234710161', 'pageCount': 46, 'publisher': 'Books LLC, Wiki Series', 'subtitle': '1700, 1700s, 1701, 1703, 1704, 1705, 1708, 1710, 1710s, 1711, 1712, 1715, 1718, 1719, 1720, 1720s, 1723, 1724, 1726, 1727,', 'title': 'Familypedia - 18th Century', 'description': 'This book consists of articles from Wikia or other free sources online.

As a result, Rome, the seat of the papacy, became the cradle of Baroque art, and masters from other parts of the Italian peninsula flocked to the region in the hopes of obtaining artistic commissions. The Historical Dictionary of Baroque Art and Architecture relates the history of the Baroque Era through a chronology, an introductory essay, a bibliography, and over 500 cross-referenced dictionary entries on such icons as Gian Lorenzo Bernini, Caravaggio, Annibale Carracci, Diego Velázquez, Peter Paul Rubens, Rembrandt van Rijn, and Johannes Vermeer, as well as sculptors, architects, patrons, other historical figures, and events.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9781461659198', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=VIlA0kuX5DAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=VIlA0kuX5DAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '1461659191', 'pageCount': 642, 'authors': ['Lilian H.

How monodirectional was the flow of power in such representations? To what extent did the travelling observer also participate and become influenced by the phenomena he tried to depict without attachment? What variety of motivations lay behind the desire to know and represent the Oriental other—was it simply a question of political control? Or were there deeper, more enigmatic factors at play—sexuality, existential affirmation, even utter idiosyncrasy? How various and diverse was the Western response to the East—can we discern degrees of sympathy, knowledge, and difference in the various Orients offered to us by the canonical and non-canonical fi¬gu¬res of 18th century English letters? Baktir\'s study provides answers to many aspects of these questions, through a detailed examination of very different texts.Baktir does not completely reject Said\'s argument that European writers created a separate discourse to represent the Orient; rather, he shows us that there was also a dialogic and negotiating tendency which did not make a radical distinction between the East and the West. Relying his argument on 18th century pseudo-oriental letters, oriental tales, and oriental travelogues, Baktir demonstrates that the representation of the Ottoman Orient in 18th century English literature differs essentially from earlier centuries because a developing critical and liberal spirit established a negotiation between the two worlds. In this book, he indicates how the critical and inquisitive spirit of the age of Enlightenment interanimated Oriental and European cultures.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9783838261324', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=klwxBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=klwxBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '3838261321', 'pageCount': 220, 'authors': ['Hasan Baktir'], 'id': 'klwxBgAAQBAJ'}, {'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=4GOtlAEACAAJ&dq=18th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'ISBN_13': '9781156712863', 'ISBN_10': '1156712866', 'pageCount': 124, 'subtitle': '18th Century in Canada, 18th Century in Mexico, 18th Century in the British Empire, 18th Century in the Caribbean, 18th Century in the Thirteen Colonies, 18th Century in the United States, War of the Spanish Succession', 'title': '18th Century in North America', 'description': "Please note that the content of this book primarily consists of articles available from Wikipedia or other free sources online.

Excerpt: George WishartGeorge Wishart (c. 1513 1 March 1546) was a Scottish religious reformer and Protestant martyr .He belonged to a younger branch of the Wisharts of Pitarrow near Montrose . He may have graduated M.A., probably at King\'s College, Aberdeen, and was certainly a student at the University of Leuven, from which he graduated in 1531. He taught the New Testament in Greek as schoolmaster at Montrose, until investigated for heresy by the Bishop of Brechin in 1538. He fled to England, where a similar charge was brought against him at Bristol in the following year by Thomas Cromwell . Under examination by Archbishop Thomas Cranmer he recanted some utterances. In 1539 or 1540 he may have visited Germany and Switzerland, but by 1542 he had entered Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, where he studied and taught. In 1543 he returned to Scotland, in the train of a Scottish embassy which had come to London to consider the treaty of marriage between Prince Edward (later Edward VI of England ) and the infant Mary, Queen of Scots . He returned to Montrose, where again he taught Scripture.He may have been the "Scottish man called Wishart" implicated in a 1544 English plot against Cardinal David Beaton .

Excerpt: Revivalism refers to the Calvinist and Wesleyan revival, called the Great Awakening, in North America which saw the development of evangelical Congregationalist, Presbyterian, Baptist, and new Methodist churches. The Calvinist and Wesleyan revival, called the Great Awakening, established the Congregationalist, Presbyterian, Baptist, and new Methodist churches on competitive footing for social influence in North America. However, as that great "revival of religion" began to wane, a new era of secularism began to overwhelm the social gains that had been experienced by Evangelical churches. Furthermore, that revival had popularized the strong opinion that Evangelical religions were weakened and divided, primarily due to unreasonable loyalty to creeds and doctrines which made salvation, and Christian unity, seem unattainable. This sentiment gave rise to the Second Great Awakening which had a strong primitivist theme of trying to restore an older, purer form of Christianity. The First Great Awakening was a wave of religious enthusiasm among Protestants that swept the American colonies in the 1730s and 1740s, leaving a permanent impact on American religion. It emphasising the traditional Reformed virtues of Godly preaching, rudimentary liturgy, and a deep sense of personal guilt and redemption by Christ Jesus.

Excerpt: The Finnish Civil War (Finnish: Swedish: ) was a part of the national and social turmoil caused by World War I (19141918) in Europe. The war was fought in Finland from 27 January to 15 May 1918 between the forces of the Social Democrats led by the People\'s Deputation of Finland, commonly called the "Reds" (punaiset), and the forces of the nonsocialist, conservative-led Senate, commonly called the "Whites" (valkoiset). The Reds were supported by Russian Soviet Republic, while the Whites received military assistance from the German Empire. In 1917, Finland was a possession of the Russian Empire. The February and October Revolutions in 1917 in Russia led to the empire\'s defeat in World War I and its total collapse. The chaos of Russia induced breakdown of the Finnish state and disintegration of Finnish society, which contained economical, social, and political cleavages and whose political system was in an unstable phase of democratization and modernization. Finland being culturally and nationally rather uniform, its subsequent civil war did not involve ethnic or religious divisions. The disintegration of Russia led to Finland\'s declaration of indepen...

Excerpt: Dietrich Bonhoeffer (German pronunciation: February 4, 1906 April 9, 1945) was a German Lutheran pastor and theologian. He was also a participant in the German Resistance movement against Nazism, a founding member of the Confessing Church. His involvement in plans by members of the Abwehr (the German Military Intelligence Office) to assassinate Adolf Hitler resulted in his arrest in April 1943 and his subsequent execution by hanging in April 1945, shortly before the war\'s end. His view of Christianity\'s role in the secular world has become very influential. Bonhoeffer attended T bingen University for a year and visited Rome, where he became conscious of the universality of the church, before he matriculated at the University of Berlin in 1924, then a centre of liberal theology under theologians such as Adolf von Harnack. Around this time, he discovered the writings of Karl Barth, an eminent Swiss theologian whose pioneering work in neo-orthodoxy was a reaction against liberal theology.

Excerpt: The 18th century lasted from 1701 to 1800 in the Gregorian calendar. However, Western historians have occasionally defined the 18th century otherwise for the purposes of their work. For example, the "short" 18th century may be defined as 1715-1789, denoting the period of time between the death of Louis XIV of France and the start of the French Revolution with an emphasis on directly interconnected events. To historians who expand the century to include larger historical movements, the "long" 18th century may run from the Glorious Revolution of 1688 to the battle of Waterloo in 1815 or even later. During the 18th century, the Enlightenment culminated in the French, Haitian and American revolutions. Philosophy and science increased in prominence. Philosophers were dreaming about a better age without the Christian fundamentalism of earlier centuries. This dream turned into a reality with the French Revolution, although it was later compromised by excess of the terror of Maximilien Robespierre. At first, the monarchies of Europe embraced enlightenment ideals, but with the French revolution they feared losing their power and joined wide coalitions with the counter-revolution. The Ottoman Empire was undergoing a protracted decline, as it failed to keep up with the technological advances in Europe. The Tulip period symbolized a period of peace and reorientation towards European society, after victory against a burgeoning Russia in 1711. Throughout the century various reforms were introduced with limited success. The 18th century also...', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9781157675440', 'ISBN_10': '1157675441', 'pageCount': 52, 'authors': ['Books, LLC'], 'id': '-4gtSgAACAAJ'}, {'categories': ['History'], 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=i4MeSgAACAAJ&dq=18th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'publisher': 'Books LLC, Wiki Series', 'subtitle': '18th-century Greek People, Greek Enlightenment, Constantine Kanaris, Ioannis Kapodistrias, Hermes O Logios, Eugenios Voulgaris, Geographia Neoteriki, Rigas Feraios, New Academy, Konstantinos Tzechanis, Nicholas Kalliakis', 'title': '18th Century in Greece', 'description': "Please note that the content of this book primarily consists of articles available from Wikipedia or other free sources online.

Excerpt: The War of the Austrian Succession (17401748), also known as King George's War in North America, and incorporating the War of Jenkins' Ear with Spain, involved nearly all the powers of Europe, except for the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, the Portuguese Empire and the Ottoman Empire. The war began under the pretext that Maria Theresa of Austria was ineligible to succeed to the Habsburg thrones of her father, Charles VI, because Salic law precluded royal inheritance by a woman, though in reality this was a convenient excuse put forward by Prussia and France to challenge Habsburg power. Austria was supported by Great Britain and the Dutch Republic, the traditional enemies of France, as well as the Kingdom of Sardinia and Saxony. France and Prussia were allied with the Electorate of Bavaria. The war ended with the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle in 1748. The most enduring military historical interest and importance of the war lies in the struggle of Prussia and the Habsburg monarchs for the region of Silesia.

Excerpt: Joseph Priestley (13 March 1733 (Old Style) - 6 February 1804) was an 18th-century English theologian, Dissenting clergyman, natural philosopher, educator, and political theorist who published over 150 works. He is usually credited with the discovery of oxygen, having isolated it in its gaseous state, although Carl Wilhelm Scheele and Antoine Lavoisier also have a claim to the discovery. During his lifetime, Priestley\'s considerable scientific reputation rested on his invention of soda water, his writings on electricity, and his discovery of several "airs" (gases), the most famous being what Priestley dubbed "dephlogisticated air" (oxygen). However, Priestley\'s determination to defend phlogiston theory and to reject what would become the chemical revolution eventually left him isolated within the scientific community. Priestley\'s science was integral to his theology, and he consistently tried to fuse Enlightenment rationalism with Christian theism. In his metaphysical texts, Priestley attempted to combine theism, materialism, and determinism, a project that has been called "audacious and original." He believed that a proper understanding of the natural world would promote human progress and eventually bring about the Christian Millennium. Priestley, who strongly believed in the free and open exchange of ideas, advocated toleration and equal rights for religious Dissenters, which also led him to help fo...', 'id': 'wFGhSgAACAAJ'}, {'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'authors': ['Books, LLC', 'General Books LLC'], 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=cMkZSgAACAAJ&dq=18th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'ISBN_13': '9781156091456', 'ISBN_10': '1156091454', 'pageCount': 70, 'publisher': 'Books LLC', 'subtitle': '18th-Century Eastern Orthodox Bishops, 18th-Century Eastern Orthodox Church Buildings', 'title': '18th-Century Eastern Orthodoxy', 'description': 'Chapters: 18th-Century Eastern Orthodox Bishops, 18th-Century Eastern Orthodox Church Buildings, 18th-Century Eastern Orthodox Martyrs, Constantin Br ncoveanu, Philokalia, Arsenije Iii ?arnojevi?, Juvenaly of Alaska, Parteniy Pavlovich, Gavriil of Belostok, Cosmas of Aetolia, Innocent of Irkutsk, Prince Vladimir Church, Kalinik I, Patriarch Cosmas Ii of Alexandria, Patriarch Kalinik Ii, Patriarch Matthew of Alexandria, Patriarch Cosmas Iii of Alexandria, Patriarch Parthenius Ii of Alexandria, Patriarch Gerasimus Ii of Alexandria, Patriarch Cyprian of Alexandria, Patriarch Gerasimus Iii of Alexandria, Patriarch Samuel of Alexandria.

Excerpt: Part of the series on Eastern Christianity The Philokalia (Gk., "love of the beautiful") is a collection of texts written between the fourth and fifteenth centuries by spiritual masters of the Christian contemplative, ascetic and hesychast tradition . While the compilation was made in the Eastern Orthodox Church, the individual works cut across denominational lines (emphasizing the considerable intellectual exchange among monastic communities in early Christianity). Writers from Eastern Orthodox, Coptic, Syriac, and even Latin Christian traditions are represented. The works were originally written for the guidance and instruction of monks in \'the practise of the contemplative life\' . The collection was compiled in the eighteenth-century by St. Nikodemos of the Holy Mountain and St. Makarios of Corinth .Although these works were individually known in Greek-reading Christian monastic culture before their inclusion in The Philokalia, their presence in this collection has resulted in a much wider readership due to its translation into several languages, including a seven-volume translation into Russian (Dobrotolyubie...', 'id': 'cMkZSgAACAAJ'}, {'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'authors': ['Source Wikipedia', 'LLC Books'], 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=IrWuSgAACAAJ&dq=18th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'ISBN_13': '9781158141654', 'ISBN_10': '1158141653', 'pageCount': 106, 'publisher': 'Books LLC, Wiki Series', 'subtitle': '18th-Century Monarchs in Asia, 18th-Century Monarchs in Europe, George Iii of the United Kingdom, Francis Ii', 'title': '18th-Century Monarchs', 'description': 'Please note that the content of this book primarily consists of articles available from Wikipedia or other free sources online.

Excerpt: George III (George William Frederick; 4 June 1738 - 29 January 1820) was King of Great Britain and King of Ireland from 25 October 1760 until the union of these two countries on 1 January 1801, after which he was King of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland until his death. He was concurrently Duke and prince-elector of Brunswick-L neburg ("Hanover") in the Holy Roman Empire until his promotion to King of Hanover on 12 October 1814. He was the third British monarch of the House of Hanover, but unlike his two Hanoverian predecessors he was born in Britain, spoke English as his first language, and never visited Hanover. His life and reign, which were longer than that of any previous British monarch, were marked by a series of military conflicts involving his kingdoms, much of the rest of Europe, and places farther afield in Africa, the Americas and Asia.

Excerpt: Der Ring des Nibelungen (The Ring of the Nibelung) is a cycle of four epic operas or (to use the composer\'s preferred term) \'dramas\' by the German composer Richard Wagner (18131883). The works are based loosely on characters from the Norse sagas and the Nibelungenlied. The four dramas, which the composer described as a trilogy with a Vorabend (\'preliminary evening\'), are often referred to as "The Ring Cycle," "Wagner\'s Ring," or simply "The Ring." Wagner wrote the libretto and music over the course of about twenty-six years, from 1848 to 1874. The four operas that constitute the Ring cycle are, in the order of the imagined events they portray: Although individual operas are performed as works in their own right, Wagner intended them to be a coherent whole, performed in a series. History provides few examples of artistic purpose so consistently followed as that which produced Wagner\'s tetralogy Der Ring des Nibelungen. As early as the 1840s, Wagner began to search Teutonic and Norse mythology for material for his epic, and it was not until the end of 1874 that the last bar of G tterd mmerung ("The Twilight of the Gods") was scored. Wagner\'s first plan was to compose one opera only, to be called Siegfried\'s Death, and for this he wrote the poem, which follows roughly the same course as that of the present G tterd mmerung, in 1848. It soon became obvious, however, that so much preliminary explanation would be ne...', 'id': 'UFekSgAACAAJ'}, {'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'pageCount': 126, 'ISBN_13': '9781158141258', 'ISBN_10': '1158141254', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=HcuiSgAACAAJ&dq=18th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'publisher': 'Books LLC', 'authors': ['LLC Books'], 'title': 'Welsh People by Century: 18th-Century Welsh People, 19th-Century Welsh People, 20th-Century Welsh People, 21st-Century Welsh People', 'description': 'Chapters: 18th-Century Welsh People, 19th-Century Welsh People, 20th-Century Welsh People, 21st-Century Welsh People, Bertrand Russell, Anthony Hopkins, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Duffy, Jack Fowler, Rebecca Llewellyn, Isaac Davis, J.

Excerpt: Bertrand Arthur William Russell, 3rd Earl Russell, OM, FRS (18 May 1872 2 February 1970) was a British philosopher, logician, mathematician, historian, and social critic. Although he spent most of his life in England, he was born in Wales where he also died, aged 97. Russell led the British "revolt against idealism" in the early 1900s. He is considered one of the founders of analytic philosophy along with his prot g Wittgenstein and his predecessor Frege, and is widely held to be one of the 20th century\'s premier logicians. He co-authored, with A. N. Whitehead, Principia Mathematica, an attempt to ground mathematics on logic. His philosophical essay "On Denoting" has been considered a "paradigm of philosophy." Both works have had a considerable influence on logic, mathematics, set theory, linguistics, and philosophy. He was a prominent anti-war activist, championing free trade between nations and anti-imperialism. Russell was imprisoned for his pacifist activism during World War I, campaigned against Adolf Hitler, for nuclear disarmament, criticised Soviet totalitarianism, called to question the creation of Israel and also to the United States of America\'s involvement in the Vietnam War. In 1950, Russell was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature, "in recognition of his varied and significant wr...More: http: //booksllc.net/?id=4163', 'id': 'HcuiSgAACAAJ'}, {'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'pageCount': 438, 'ISBN_13': '9781158101337', 'ISBN_10': '1158101333', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=aPszbwAACAAJ&dq=18th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'publisher': 'Books LLC', 'authors': ['LLC Books'], 'title': 'British People by Century: 18th-Century British People, 19th-Century British People, 20th-Century British People, 21st-Century British People', 'description': "Purchase includes free access to book updates online and a free trial membership in the publisher's book club where you can select from more than a million books without charge.

Excerpt: Saint Irenaeus (Greek: ), (2nd century AD - c. 202) was a Christian Bishop of Lugdunum in Gaul, then a part of the Roman Empire (now Lyons, France). He was an early church father and apologist, and his writings were formative in the early development of Christian theology. He was a disciple of Polycarp, who in turn was a disciple of John the Evangelist. Irenaeus' best-known book, Adversus Haereses or Against Heresies (c. 180) is a detailed attack on Gnosticism, which was then a serious threat to the Church, and especially on the system of the Gnostic Valentinus. As one of the first great Christian theologians, he emphasized the traditional elements in the Church, especially the episcopate, Scripture, and tradition. Irenaeus wrote that the only way for Christians to retain unity was to humbly accept one doctrinal authorityepiscopal councils. Against the Gnostics, who said that they possessed a secret oral tradition from Jesus himself, Irenaeus maintained that the bishops in different cities are known as far back as the Apostles and none of them were Gnostics and that the bishops provided the only safe guide to the interpretation of Scripture. His writings, with those of Clement and Ignatius, are taken to hint at papal primacy.

Excerpt: Tufts Medical Center (until recently Tufts-New England Medical Center) is a medical institution in Boston, Massachusetts occupying space between Chinatown and the Theater District. New sign at the Washington Street entrance to Tufts Medical Center on the day of its renaming (March 4, 2008)It is a center for biomedical research and is the principal teaching hospital for Tufts University School of Medicine where all full-time Tufts physicians hold faculty appointments. Tufts Medical Center is subdivided into a full-service adult hospital and the Floating Hospital for Children, a full-service pediatric facility. In 1992, with the addition of a maternity service, it became the first private, full-service medical facility in Boston. Main atrium of Tufts Medical Center on the day of its renaming (March 4, 2008)Tufts Medical Center's origins date back to 1796 when the Boston Dispensary was established as the first permanent medical facility in New England, and one of the first in the United States. Early donors included Paul Revere. In 1894, the Boston Floating Hospital was established by a Congregational minister, the Rev. Rufus Tobey. At the time, many believed in the cleansing and therapeutic qualities of sea air to improve health, and Tobey had heard of a hospital ship for children in New York. For the next 33 years, two successive ships were home to the hospital for children in Boston Harbor. In 1931, after the second Floating Hospital for Children ship was destroyed in a fire, the hospital was relocated to a permanent building onshore. New England Medical Center was established in 1930 as a union of the Boston Dispensary, the Boston Floating Hospital for Children, and the Trustees of Tufts College.

It originally began as a backlash produced by a previous conflict known as La Violencia, which had been triggered by the 1948 assassination of populist political leader Jorge Elicer Gaitn. The subsequent targeting of civilians and public infrastructure by the different armed factions contributed both to the creation of the guerrillas and that of paramilitary groups organized to fight against them.

Excerpt: Australian rules football, also known as Australian football and known colloquially as Aussie rules, was first organised in Victoria in 1859 when its first rules were written by the Melbourne Football Club. By 1900, it had become the most popular sport in Victoria. Tom WillsThe complex origins of the game go back to the early 1840s and are covered in The Origins of Australian rules football On 17 May 1859, the first rules for a local code of football were written during a meeting of four members of the Melbourne Cricket Club (MCe: Tom Wills, William Hammersley, J.B. Thompson and Thomas Smith. The meeting was held at the Parade Hotel on the site of the present MCG Hotel. Wills, a renowned cricketer, was secretary of the MCC at the time. He had attended Rugby School and was familiar with the argument between the proponents of allowing players to handle the ball (ie, Rugby football) and those who wanted players to use their feet only, the style later adopted by the Football Association. Below are the rules for Australian Rules Football, alleged to have been used by the Geelong Football Club in 1859. They were originally written down by hand. Graeme Atkinson, writing in E...

Excerpt: Mary of Modena (Maria Beatrice Anna Margherita Isabella d\'Este; 5 October 1658 - 7 May 1718) was Queen consort of England, Scotland and Ireland as the second wife of King James II and VII. A devout Catholic, Mary became, in 1671, the second wife of James, Duke of York, who later succeeded his older brother Charles II as King James II. Mary was uninterested in politics and devoted to James and her children, two of whom survived to adulthood: the Jacobite claimant to the English, Scottish and Irish thrones, James Francis Edward Stuart, known as "The Old Pretender," and Princess Louise Mary. Born a princess of the Italian Duchy of Modena, Mary is primarily remembered for the controversial birth of James Francis Edward, her only surviving son. The majority of the English public believed he was a changeling, brought into the birth-chamber in a warming-pan, in order to perpetuate King James II\'s Catholic dynasty. Although the accusation was entirely false, and the subsequent privy council investigation only reaffirmed this, James Francis Edward\'s birth was a contributing factor to the Glorious Revolution. The revolution deposed James II and replaced him with his daughter from his first marriage Mary and...', 'id': 'uhojSwAACAAJ'}, {'categories': ['History'], 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=BWiGQXM6xEAC&dq=18th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'publisher': 'Oxford University Press, USA', 'title': 'Hanoverian Britain: Oxford Bibliographies Online Research Guide', 'description': 'This ebook is a selective guide designed to help scholars and students of the ancient world find reliable sources of information by directing them to the best available scholarly materials in whatever form or format they appear from books, chapters, and journal articles to online archives, electronic data sets, and blogs.

The book reviews the way that planning policies, architectural trends and economic forces have undermined the viability of urban areas in Britain since the Industrial Revolution. Now that much post-war planning philosophy is being discredited we are left with few urban models other than garden city inspired suburbia. Are these appropriate in the 21st century given environmental concerns, demographic change, social and economic pressures? The authors suggest that these trends point to a very different urban future. The authors argue that we must reform our towns and cities so that they become attractive, humane places where people will choose to live. The Sustainable Urban Neighbourhood is a model for such reform and the book describes what this would look like and how it might be brought about.", 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9781136434907', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=wswsBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=wswsBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '1136434909', 'pageCount': 288, 'authors': ['David Rudlin', 'Nicholas Falk'], 'id': 'wswsBgAAQBAJ'}, {'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'pageCount': 484, 'ISBN_13': '9781171371830', 'ISBN_10': '1171371837', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=M7TTcQAACAAJ&dq=18th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'publisher': 'Gale ECCO, Print Editions', 'authors': ['Thomas Watkins'], 'title': 'Travels Through Switzerland, Italy, Sicily, the Greek Islands to Constantinople; Through Part of Greece, Ragusa, and the Dalmatian Isles; in a Series', 'description': 'The 18th century was a wealth of knowledge, exploration and rapidly growing technology and expanding record-keeping made possible by advances in the printing press.

Excerpt: Banda Singh Bahadur (Punjabi: )(1670-1716) was a Sikh warrior and martyr. He became part of struggle against the Mughal Empire in the early 18th century, after meeting Guru Gobind Singh. Guru Gobind Singh gave him the new name of Banda Singh Bahadur. He is best known for the sack of the Mughal provincial capital, Sirhind, and is revered as one of the most hallowed martyrs of the Khalsa. His brief agrarian uprising against the Mughal administration in the Punjab region of northern India was a critical event in the development of the Dal Khalsa and the Sikh Misls, which eventually led to Ranjit Singh capturing Lahore in 1799 and establishing the Sikh Kingdom of the Punjab. After establishing his authority in Punjab, Banda Singh Bahadur abolished the zamindari system, and granted property rights to the actual tillers of the land. There are different views regarding origin of Banda Singh Bahadur: Sardar Banda Singh Bhadhur Great Sikh warrior whose real caste background was changed as Rajput by Anti-Brahman people. His family still exist in "poonch" area of kashmir. His mother side was from "Sudan" sub caste of Brahmans and father side was Bhardwaj. Banda\'s original name was Lakhsman Dev Bharadwaj and all authentic records indicate that he was a Brahman. Guru Gobind Singh hoped that Emperor Bahadur Shah would fulfill his promise against the Governor of Sirhind, and his accomplices for persecuting the people of Punjab.

Excerpt: A musket is a muzzle-loaded, smooth bore long gun, fired from the shoulder. Muskets were designed for use by infantry. A soldier armed with a musket had the designation musketman or musketeer. The musket replaced the arquebus, and was in turn replaced by the rifle. The term "musket" is applied to a variety of weapons, including the long, heavy guns with matchlock or wheel lock and loose powder fired with the gun barrel resting on a stand, and also lighter weapons with Snaphance, flintlock or caplock and bullets using a stabilizing spin (Mini ball), affixed with a bayonet. 16th-century troops armed with a heavy version of the arquebus called a musket were specialists supporting the arquebusiers and pikemen formations. By the start of the 18th century, a lighter version of the musket had edged out the arquebus, and the addition of the bayonet edged out the pike, and almost all infantry became musketeers. In the 18th century, improvements in ammunition and firing methods allowed rifling to be practical for military use, and the term "rifled gun" gave way to "rifle." In the 19th century, rifled muskets (which were technically rifles, but were referred to as muskets) became common which combined the advantages of rifles and muskets. About the time of the introduction of cartridge, breechloading, and multiple rounds of ammunition just a few years later, muskets fell out of fashion. Musket calibers ranged from 0.5 inches (13 mm) to 0.8 inches (20 mm).

Cone describes the rise of reform organizations during the controversy in Parliament over John Wilkes, who attempted to blow up Parliament in the 1760s, and he charts the progress of these organizations until they were disbanded, temporarily, after the sedition trials of 1794. Analyzing the goals and accomplishments of the reformers, Cone stresses that they worked for constitutional and civil not social or economic changes. The reformers were, in fact, more interested in restoring ""Anglo-Saxon"" liberties and the benefits of the Glorious Revolution of 1688 than in carrying out the ideas of Rousseau or borrowing from the example of the Paris Commune. If there were foreign influences on the English radicals, these were provided by former American colonists who had used committees of correspondence and constituent assemblies to such good effect against the monarchy. Cone considers the fluctuating fortunes of the reformers. At various times the radicals had important allies in Parliament, like Charles James Fox and William Pitt, and included in their number such accomplished figures as Richard Price, the moral philosopher, and Joseph Priestley, the chemist, as well as dissenting ministers. The ""Jacobins"" achieved their greatest publicity when Tom Paine replied to Edmund Burke\'s Reflections on the Revolution in France with his own Rights of Man and in the pamphlet war that followed.

Meant to be an undeclared, scholarly, -mysterious- companion to the French monarchy, the Academie created a powerful attraction for the highest classes, inspiring critics of different stripes; considered to be the highest expression of Frenchness, it excluded different groups based on class, gender, race/ethnicity, religion, ideology, and nationality. The self-proclaimed heir to ancient Greek and Roman scholarship, the Academie also claims to represent Europe, the West, and even Humanity. However, as an academic institution, it has experienced -dialectical- arguments between traditional (feudal) elitism, and scholarly elitism as both sought to define French culture in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. -Trustees of taste- and promoters of purity, the Academiciens and their strong supporters followed the troubled evolution of the word race and of social distinction. Borrowing from inter-European ethnic issues and nationalism, subscribers to the growing -racial- distinction had the features of the colonized analyzed with the French, and by extension, European and Western sense of social distinction in mind. Consequently the colonized ended up at the lowest end of the social scale; in turn, this placement explained the application of European feudal norms of exploitation on the colonies and created the more controversial and dreaded concept of -racism-.

It shows how Italians used perceptions of Chinese culture to address local and transnational developments, particularly Enlightenment and secular reform initiatives. Its focus on the texts and performance practices of opera, an entertainment form accessible to a wide public, reveals cultural operations and identities harder to detect in non-fictional reformist writings, the texts traditionally privileged to explain Italian mediations of Enlightenment ideas. In its close reading of nine libretti of the most salient Settecento operas treating China (opere serie and opere buffe by authors including Metastasio, Zeno, Goldoni and Lorenzi), Pagodas in Play differentiates Italian iterations of Chinese culture from French and English counterparts. It further challenges certain tenets of orientalism, showing how it operates when nationalist and/or colonialist projects are absent, and how orientalist practices in eighteenth-century Italy exhibit early on the complexity some scholars locate only in the twentieth century.

Espana. hace mas anos de los que le gustaria. pero menos de los que piensa la gente. Paso su infancia y gran parte de su juventud en Madrid. En 1989 se fue a vivir a Nueva York donde se caso, tuvo tres hijos (que de alguna manera que ella no acaba de comprender se hicieron adolescentes). y empezo su carrera como autora, editora y traductora de de libros. En las pocas ocasiones en las que no esta delante de su ordenador escribiendo, contestando e-mails, hablando o descargando fotos, se dedica a jugar y entrenar a un labrador para que se convierta un dia en un gran perro-guia de ciegos. "In many ways," Robert J.C. Young writes, "colonization from the very first carried with it the seeds of its own destruction." Imperial Affliction examines some ways in which Young\'s observation could be applied to problems of subjectivity and influence within the colonizing nations themselves, particularly eighteenth-century Britain. How might these "seeds of destruction" manifest themselves as problems of identity? How might the very selves with greatest access to self-affirmation---the idea of the empire, the idea of British citizenry, the idea of the British self---actually find themselves vulnerable, confused, or damaged? Using multiple forms of postcolonial critique, this book turns back to salient eighteenth-century British lives and work for a different kind of enlightenment. Among its central subjects are the elusive subjectivity of William Collins; the exilic religious experience of William Cowper and its multiple readings in the twentieth century by a self-fashioned exilic, Donald Davie; the "missed encounter" between Christopher Smart and Samuel Johnson, and the ways in which that problem was re-inscribed in the work of W. Jackson Bate and Lionel Trilling; the problem of imperial fixity in James Cook\'s journals with a view to Gray\'s "Elegy" and Gold-smith\'s "Deserted Village"; and the problem of purity as a paradoxically privileged and exilic force in the work of John Newton and Christopher Smart. In these explorations, this book illustrates both an expanded view of eighteenth-century colonial liabilities and a new emphasis on postcolonial critique as a means of exploring the fissures always present in imperial ambition.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9781433108723', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=mEP_Qct2op8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=mEP_Qct2op8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '1433108720', 'pageCount': 182, 'authors': ['Thomas Simmons'], 'id': 'mEP_Qct2op8C'}, {'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'authors': ['John Dart'], 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=mGmjbwAACAAJ&dq=18th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'ISBN_13': '9781170674574', 'ISBN_10': '1170674577', 'pageCount': 76, 'publisher': 'Gale ECCO, Print Editions', 'subtitle': 'A Poem ...', 'title': 'Westminster-Abbey', 'description': 'The 18th century was a wealth of knowledge, exploration and rapidly growing technology and expanding record-keeping made possible by advances in the printing press.

The money farmers' strategy, as in credit card companies, is to lend as much as the subject target can borrow and still pay fees, charges and interest payments. This means to encourage them to borrow, loan after loan, consolidate all other loans and keep lending - up until the crop of foreign exchange seems in jeopardy. The ideal from the Lending Agency viewpoint is to get an African country maxed out on loans to the point that it actually operates all of its government and the nation on LOANS. Once that goal is achieved, you basically have a never ending crop of FOREIGN EXCHANGE from helpless and hopeless African governments and people.

This book is unique in its approach to seating because it draws together evidence that relates to seating that facilitates health and task while also addressing aesthetic factors. This evidence creates an understanding of how seats may be designed to not only promote bodily health but also allow functional optimisation of sitting and seating.

These dialectical processes are driven by a variety of actors: political elites, multinational companies, warlords, donor governments, local traders, international NGOs, etc. As a result substantial parts of Africa witness the emergence of new regimes of territoriality: re-ordered states, transnational and sub-national entities, new localities and transborder formations.

History helps clarify where globalization comes from, how it relates to broad processes of change, and why it rouses controversy. In Globalization in World History, Peter N. Stearns argues that although the term is a relatively new one, the process of globalization has roots much further back in time. He shows how tracing this process of change can also help to define the concept of globalization as we understand it today. The book examines major changes in global interactions from 1000 CE onward, and defines four major turning points that have accelerated the process of globalization. Issues covered include: which factors have shaped the process of globalization – including economics, migration, disease transmission, culture, the environment and politics how and why reactions to globalization differ across societies – regions examined include Japan, the Middle East, Africa and China the advantages and disadvantages brought by globalization.

Yet little of this important work has filtered down beyond specialists in their respective academic fields. Women and Judaism brings the broad new insights they have uncovered to the world. Women and Judaism communicates this research to a wider public of students and educated readers outside of the academy by presenting accessible and engaging chapters written by key senior scholars that introduce the reader to different aspects of women and Judaism. The contributors discuss feminist approaches to Jewish law and Torah study, the spirituality of Eastern European Jewish women, Jewish women in American literature, and many other issues.

History helps clarify where globalization comes from, how it relates to broad processes of change, and why it rouses controversy. In Globalization in World History, Peter N. Stearns argues that although the term is a relatively new one, the process of globalization has roots much further back in time. He shows how tracing this process of change can also help to define the concept of globalization as we understand it today. The book examines major changes in global interactions from 1000 CE onward, and defines four major turning points that have accelerated the process of globalization. Issues covered include: which factors have shaped the process of globalization – including economics, migration, disease transmission, culture, the environment and politics how and why reactions to globalization differ across societies – regions examined include Japan, the Middle East, Africa and China the advantages and disadvantages brought by globalization. The book is a vital contribution to the study of world history, and is a useful companion for students of politics and sociology.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9781135259921', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_NCOAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_NCOAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '1135259925', 'pageCount': 176, 'authors': ['Peter N.

Starting with the ideas of ancient civilizations that air, earth, fire and water were the basic ingredients of all matter, it traces the development of the science of chemistry beginning within the ranks of the alchemists. First, the idea of elements grew and then the atomic nature of matter was verified. Physicists had entered the scene, showing the nature of atoms in terms of fundamental particles and then introducing the concept of wave-particle duality that altered the basic concepts of what matter was. Finally the physicists discovered a panoply of fundamental particles, some observed within atom-smashing machines and the existence of others merely postulated. In parallel with the above there is a description of various kinds of matter as it affects everyday life OCo including the nature of matter associated with life itself. The way that early man used the materials directly given by nature, such as stone, wood and animal skins, is followed by the use of materials requiring some process to be employed OCo e.g. metals which include bronze and also concrete. Some important modern materials are discussed, such as synthetic fibres and plastics and semiconductors, and potentially important future products from new developments in nanotechnology.

The history of warfare first emerges from legend in Mesopotamia, the cradle of civilization, around 3,000 years before the birth of Christ. The first armies that we know about fought in Sumeria, Ancient Egypt, and Syria. From these first battles, fought with spears or axes on horseback or on foot, War traces the campaigns and conflicts that have shaped world history and examines the evolution of military tactics and technology. The story of the development from these primitive battles to the global conflicts of the 20th century and the modern 'War on Terror' is the story of humanity itself, reflecting the same political, cultural and technological forces that have defined human history. From longbows to laser-guided missiles; from chariots to jet aircraft; and from Samurai warriors to SAS soldiers, War provides the definitive visual chronicle of this intense, brutal, and often heroic tale. War combines a coherent and compelling spread-by-spread historical narrative with a wealth of supporting features on weapons and technology, strategy and tactics, the experience of war, and history's fighting elites to recount the epic 5,000-year story of warfare and combat through the ages.", 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9780756668174', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=fKG5VcYPtp0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=fKG5VcYPtp0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '0756668174', 'pageCount': 512, 'authors': ['DK Publishing'], 'id': 'fKG5VcYPtp0C'}, {'categories': ['Religion'], 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=Y44BmYmiwoYC&dq=18th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'averageRating': 5.0, 'publisher': 'Ignatius Press', 'title': 'The Dividing of Christendom', 'description': 'How did Catholics and Protestants come to be divided? What impact has their division had on Western culture? Historian Christopher Dawson answers these and other important questions in his classic study, The Dividing of Christendom. Based on Dawson\'s Harvard lectures, this book provides a highly readable, masterful overview of the factors that led to one of the deepest divides in Western history-one that endures and gave momentum to social, cultural and political changes whose consequences are still with us. The decline of medieval unity, the Renaissance, the Protestant and Catholic Reformations, the cultures of divided Christendom, the rise of modern secular culture, the Enlightenment, and the French Revolution are all presented in an engagingly, popular style. This is a work for all Western Christians who want to understand the historical origins of their present divisions and possible ways of overcoming them. Dawson writes, "Of all divisions between Christians, that between Catholics and Protestants is the deepest and the most pregnant in its historical consequences. It is so deep that we cannot see any solution to it in the present period and under existing historical circumstances. But at least it is possible for us to take the first step by attempting to overcome the enormous gap in mutual understanding which has hitherto rendered any intellectual contact or collaboration impossible." Ecumenism progressed significantly after Dawson penned those words, especially following the Second Vatican Council, but the problem of Christian disunity persists. This is a fitting subject for Christopher Dawson, whose genius was to present the broad sweep of history with verve, clarity, insight and authority. Only a deep appreciation of how the present Christian divisions arose, Dawson argues in The Dividing of Christendom, will permit an authentic return to full Christian unity.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9781586172381', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Y44BmYmiwoYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Y44BmYmiwoYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '1586172387', 'pageCount': 262, 'authors': ['Christopher Dawson'], 'id': 'Y44BmYmiwoYC'}, {'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'pageCount': 374, 'ISBN_13': '9781171002673', 'ISBN_10': '117100267X', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=Z2nJbwAACAAJ&dq=18th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'publisher': 'Gale ECCO, Print Editions', 'authors': ['Bartholomaeus Ziegenbalg'], 'title': 'Thirty Four Conferences Between the Danish Missionaries and the Malabarian Bramans in the East Indies, Concerning the Truth of the Christian Relig', 'description': "The 18th century was a wealth of knowledge, exploration and rapidly growing technology and expanding record-keeping made possible by advances in the printing press.

Works collected here include masterpieces by David Hume, Immanuel Kant, and Jean-Jacques Rousseau, as well as religious sermons and moral debates on the issues of the day, such as the slave trade. The Age of Reason saw conflict between Protestantism and Catholicism transformed into one between faith and logic -- a debate that continues in the twenty-first century.++++The below data was compiled from various identification fields in the bibliographic record of this title.

The state and other bodies of governance play an important role in the development of capitalist market societies since the 18th century. But modern market economies are to a large degree a product of the interplay between market and governance. Yet we are often told a strikingly different tale about the modern economy, at least how it ought to work and operate - as far as possible without public interference. Even more frequently we have been taught that the modern capitalist market economy is a product of an industrial revolution, originating with the UK in the middle of the 18th century propelled by laissez faire and the triumph of free markets which gradually liberated themselves from the grip of an old dirigiste state. This book argues that in order to get a better understanding of this period and the rise of modern industrial capitalism it is necessary to link the industrial revolution in its various forms to a political and institutional context of state-making and the creation of modern national states. Professor Magnusson demonstrates that a historical narrative which does not acknowledge the role of the state and public governance for the establishment of the modern capitalist market economy is fundamentally flawed.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9781135256647', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=jc2NAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=jc2NAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '1135256640', 'pageCount': 208, 'authors': ['Lars Magnusson'], 'id': 'jc2NAgAAQBAJ'}, {'categories': ['Technology & Engineering'], 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=Qm4p0D5h8tgC&dq=18th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'publisher': 'Cengage Learning', 'title': 'Principles of Geotechnical Engineering - SI Version', 'description': 'Intended as an introductory text in soil mechanics, the seventh edition of Das, PRINCIPLES OF GEOTECHNICAL ENGINEERING offers an overview of soil properties and mechanics together with coverage of field practices and basic engineering procedure.

Over time, the two groups grew closer and recognized significant overlap in their theoretical and research interests, but there were also differences in their traditions that kept them apart. While both groups agreed that communication is a practical discipline, journalism professors focused a great deal of their attention on the education of media professionals. Speech professors, on the other hand, often were more oriented to the liberal arts and valued the fact that communication could be approached from a variety of traditions, including the arts, humanities, social sciences, and even the sciences. A key term in 21st Century communication, however, is convergence. Not only are media and technology converging with each other to produce new means of communicating, but individuals are increasingly using both new and existing communication tools to create new forms of communication. This convergence forces the various "camps" within the communication discipline to draw upon each other\'s theories and research methods to keep up with explaining the rapidly changing communication environment. This convergence of ideas and theories provides a space to challenge conventional ways of thinking about the communication discipline, and that\'s the goal of the SAGE 21st Century Reference Series volumes on Communication. General Editor William F. Eadie has sought to honor the diversity of the study of communication but also integrate that diversity into a coherent form, dividing communication study into four basic properties: 1) processes, 2) forms and types of communication, 3) characteristics to consider in creating messages, and 4) relationships between communicators. Via 100 chapters, this 2-volume set (available in both print and electronic formats) highlights the most important topics, issues, questions, and debates any student obtaining a degree in the field of communication ought to have mastered for effectiveness in the 21st Century. The purpose is to provide undergraduate majors with an authoritative reference source that will serve their research needs going forward in this exciting field with more detailed information than encyclopedia entries but not as much jargon, detail or density as a journal article or a research handbook chapter. Comprehensive coverage captures all the major themes and subfields within communication. For instance, Volume 1 themes include the discipline of communication, approaches to the study of communication, key processes of communication, forms and types of communication, key characteristics of messages, key communication relationships, factors affecting communication, and challenges and opportunities for communication. Themes in Volume 2 are media as communication, communication as a profession, journalism, public relations, advertising, and media management. Authoritative content is provided by a stellar casts of authors who bring diverse approaches, diverse styles, and different points of view. Curricular-driven emphasis provides students with initial footholds on topics of interest in researching for term papers, in preparing for GREs, in consulting to determine directions to take in pursuing a senior thesis, graduate degree, career, etc. Uniform chapter structures make it easy for students to locate key information, with a more-or-less common chapter format of Introduction, Theory, Methods, Applications, Comparisons, Future Directions, Summary, Bibliography & Suggestions for Further Reading, and Cross References.

It investigates the historic role of St. Petersburg as Russia’s “window on Europe”, and features the great masterworks of Western European art (namely, Dutch) assembled and prized in the Hermitage by the Romanov dynasty, by Peter the Great and by his spiritual follower and enlightener - Catherine the Great, in particular. Over the course of centuries, Russian tsars continuously borrowed ideas and concepts from their Western neighbors. St. Petersburg was to mark the way for Russia to become modern by creating an environment that could be maintained only by broader and deeper contact with the West. However, Peter Rietbergen in his essay on “Russia between West and East” stresses “the inherent duality in Russian culture, and in the national character, as half-Asian, half-European”. This issue is to be discussed and evaluated in the paper. A chronological overview of the main acquisitions of Dutch paintings to the Hermitage in the course of the XVIII century is included in the paper. It is hoped that the paper will add to the understanding of the described epoch of the Russian Empire and will expose the role it played in defining its path of historical development. The thesis statement investigated in the paper is as follows: “Has the borrowing of cultural values from Western Europe contributed to the Europeanization of Russia in the XVIII century?” Under the term “cultural values” artefacts, objects of art, enlightening ideas and books, as well as progressive reforms, European fashion and lifestyle, etc are implied. One of the aims of the research is to demonstrate that art which has been broadly studied from divergent viewpoints of style, content, iconography, philosophy, and the social sciences, can also be approached as a function of economic and socio-political motives. A method of comparative analysis of the Westernizing cultural policies by Peter I and later, by Catherine II is used.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9783640397587', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=BYTuQhKru00C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=BYTuQhKru00C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '3640397584', 'pageCount': 11, 'authors': ['Nadia Ptashchenko'], 'id': 'BYTuQhKru00C'}, {'categories': ['Religion'], 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=kdJQ4GQUPecC&dq=18th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'averageRating': 4.5, 'publisher': 'Counterpoint', 'subtitle': 'Life and Zen Poetry in 18th Century Kyoto', 'title': 'The Old Tea Seller', 'description': "Poet, Zen Buddhist priest, renowned thinker, and seller of tea — Baisao was all of these things, as well as being a bit of an eccentric.

Table of Contents: Preface Introduction: Constructing the Nation 1. The National and the Sacred 2. The Politics of Patriotism and National Sentiment 3. English Barbarians, French Martyrs 4. National Memory and the Canon of Great Frenchmen 5. National Character and the Republican Imagination 6. National Language and the Revolutionary Crucible Conclusion: Toward the Present Day and the End of Nationalism Notes Note on Internet Appendices and Bibliography Index Reviews of this book: Bell delineates the history of nationalism in France, tracing its origins to the 17th century. He shows how in 18th-century France, political and intellectual leaders made perfect national unity a priority, allowing the construction of the nation to take precedence over other political tasks. The goal was to provide all French people with the same language, laws, customs, and values. Bell argues that while the French leaders hoped that patriotism and national sentiment would replace religion as the binding force, it was actually religion that was a major (but not exclusive) factor in helping the French see the world around them. This period of history was the beginning of the first large-scale nationalist program. Bell also shows how the relationship between nationalism and religion contributes to the French national identity debate today. Bell's comprehensive and well-documented book is written in an accessible style...Recommended for French and European history collections. --Mary Salony, Library Journal Reviews of this book: At the center of Bell's subtle and intricate argument is religion. Religion, he suggests, was changing in the 18th century. And with men less likely to see God as an interventionist presence in their daily lives and more likely to stress God's distant, inscrutable quality, space was opened up for an autonomous realm of human action, described by a series of interconnected words: society, public opinion, civilization, fatherland and nation. --Richard Vinen, New York Times Book Review Reviews of this book: David Bell has interesting things to say about the French kindred and about an important aspect of their life together. The Cult of the Nation in France is about the way a particular kind of togetherness and a novel kind of identity were implanted, grew (and may have begun to wither) in France's fertile soil. The nation, he argues, is no spontaneous growth but a political artifact: not organic like a tree but constructed like a city. --Eugen Weber, Los Angeles Times Reviews of this book: Bell argues in his excellent analysis of the 18th-century conceptual birth of French nationalism that nationalism emerged at a point when French intellectuals increasingly came to see God as distant from human affairs and sough to separate religious passions from political life...A masterful, thought-provoking [study]. --P. G. Wallace, Choice Reviews of this book: This excellent book is at once a valuable account of the development of the concept of the nation in France and an important example of the use that can be made of the culture of print...Bell argues that right-wing nationalism has belonged consistently to a minority and that there has been a basic continuity in French republican nationalism over the past two centuries, views that not all will share, but arguments that testify to the importance of this well-crafted work. --Jeremy Black, History A notable addition to the expanding literature on nationalism in general and of French nationalism in particular, The Cult of the Nation in France explores how national affiliation became part of individual identity. It demonstrates the connections between nationalism and religion, without falling into the simple trap of treating nationalism as another religion. Against the present-day challenges faced by French republican nationalism, Bell insightfully examines the paradoxical process whereby the French came to posit themselves as a union of politically and spiritually like-minded citizens. --Joan B. Landes, Pennsylvania State University A formidably intelligent and beautifully written analysis of how the French came to perceive their nation as a political construction. Its breadth, together with its highly original discussion of the role of religion, makes The Cult of the Nation in France essential reading both for students of nationalism and for anyone wanting to understand current French debates on culture, ethnicity, and identity. --Linda Colley, London School of Economics and Political Science David Bell is one of the most talented young historians working in any field. This fascinating, brilliantly argued, and beautifully written study demonstrates the multi-stranded origins of the concept of the nation in France. Bell's major contribution is to place the timing of this crucial evolution well before the Revolution of 1789. He never loses sight of the linguistic and cultural complexity of France, bringing to a conclusion the story of French nationalism in our era. --John Merriman, Yale University", 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9780674020726', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ZtDBJ4UrwxkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ZtDBJ4UrwxkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '0674020723', 'pageCount': 320, 'authors': ['David Avrom.

This collection comprises several essays considering the contemporary relevance of the work of Michel Foucault. While Foucault is best remembered for his historical inquiries into the origins of “disciplinary” society in a period extending from the 16th to the 19th centuries, it seems that today, under the conditions of global modernity, the relevance of his ideas are called into question. With the increasing ubiquity of markets, the break up of centralized states and the dissolution of national boundaries, together with new scientific and political discourses on biological life, the world of today seems far removed from the bounded, disciplinary societies Foucault described in his most famous books. Yet in recent years, it has become apparent that Foucault’s thoughts on modern society have not been exhausted, and, indeed, that much remains to be explored. Within this volume, novel interpretations and thematic developments of key Foucauldian concepts are presented in the works of 24 authors. Prominent among them are new forms of neoliberal economic conduct framed by distinct governmentalities; new critical concepts of biological life reflected in Foucault’s analysis of biopower, and new theoretical treatments of the effects of subjectivation. Moreover, included among these theoretical departures are empirical studies of contemporary formations of religion and spiritual practice, consumerism, race and racism, the discourse of genetics and the life sciences, surveillance and incarceration, and new social movements. Drawn from a conference held at the University of Massachusetts, Boston bearing the same title, A Foucault for the 21st Century: Governnentality, Biopolitics and Discipline in the New Millennium both expands our understanding of Foucault’s central theoretical legacy, and applies his ideas to a range of contemporary empirical phenomena.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9781443804660', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NaIYBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NaIYBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '1443804665', 'pageCount': 399, 'authors': ['Sam Binkley', 'Jorge Capetillo'], 'id': 'NaIYBwAAQBAJ'}, {'categories': ['Art'], 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=sc0EAAAAQBAJ&dq=18th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'publisher': 'Cengage Learning', 'title': 'Gardner’s Art through the Ages: Backpack Edition, Book D, Modern Europe and America', 'description': 'Gardner’s Art through the Ages: The Western Perspective, 13th Edition is now available in a Backpack Edition comprised of four easy-to-carry paperbacks!

The definition of its artistic peculiarity with respect to the common European artistic process is an important problem of modern Georgian art criticism. Beginning with the renaissance European culture and easel painting have followed a centuries-old path of stylistic evolution and despite the heterogeneous development of European painting, general artistic processes occurred simultaneously in different European countries, in which the historical unity of European painting is manifested. In the second half of the 18th century Georgia witnessed acceleration, contraction, uneven development of this centuries-old process due to the specific character of the political, social and economic development of Georgia, quite different from that of other countries. Georgian easel painting has no clearly defined regularities of stylistic development. Parallelism of various stylistic tendencies or artistic trends, their merging instead of alternation taking place within the narrow chronological limits of its development, complicates the specification of stylistic peculiarities of painting of this period. The purpose of this book is to define basic artistic and stylistic tendencies of Georgian easel painting in relation to its contemporary Russian and European painting on the basis of the application of typological and comparative methods.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9781607417385', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=84VFPgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=84VFPgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '1607417383', 'pageCount': 172, 'authors': ['Irina Arsenishvili'], 'id': '84VFPgAACAAJ'}, {'categories': ['Architecture'], 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=QMrZQgAACAAJ&dq=18th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'publisher': 'Wiltshire Archaeological & Natural', 'subtitle': 'The Early 18th Century Town House of a Devizes Clothier', 'title': "Samuel Powell's House", 'description': "Have you ever walked past a magnificent old house and wondered who lives there? You might even have asked yourself, who has lived there over the centuries since it was built, or even who built it. Samuel Powell's House: The Early 18th Century Town House of a Derizes Clothier is the culmination of three years of detailed research and survey work which brings the fascinating 313 year history of this Grade II listed house to life. Through the remarkable survival of deeds and sale documents back to 1696, other documentary sources and the personal reminiscences of former inhabitants we now have an almost complete list of the house's owners and occupiers. From the ambitious man who had it constructed and his wayward son, to one of the first man midwives and the inspiration for a fictional hero, each has an engaging story to tell. It also charts the ordinary, but no less eventful, lives of less prominent occupiers such as auctioneers, solicitors clerks, and evacuated wartime children. These stories, combined with a detailed survey of the house, its fixtures, fittings and decoration, give us an amazing insight into not only the character and tastes of its builder, but of the many people who have left their personal marks on the house over its whole history.", 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9780947723156', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=QMrZQgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=QMrZQgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '0947723153', 'pageCount': 142, 'authors': ['Matthew McMurray'], 'id': 'QMrZQgAACAAJ'}, {'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=q9BPbwAACAAJ&dq=18th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'averageRating': 3.0, 'publisher': 'Gale ECCO, Print Editions', 'subtitle': 'A Romance. in Three Volumes. --Vol. II.

But they also marveled at the people they saw, both male and female. In an era in which castrati were "rock stars," men served women as cicisbei, and dandified Englishmen became macaroni, Italy was perceived to be a place where men became women. The great publicity surrounding female poets, journalists, artists, anatomists, and scientists, and the visible roles for such women in salons, academies, and universities in many Italian cities also made visitors wonder whether women had become men. Such images, of course, were stereotypes, but they were nonetheless grounded in a reality that was unique to the Italian peninsula. This volume illuminates the social and cultural landscape of eighteenth-century Italy by exploring how questions of gender in music, art, literature, science, and medicine shaped perceptions of Italy in the age of the Grand Tour.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9780804759045', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=mwa5sc2qZ-UC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=mwa5sc2qZ-UC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '0804759049', 'pageCount': 490, 'authors': ['Paula Findlen', 'Wendy Wassyng Roworth', 'Catherine M.

In spite of his position as a national institution and his appeal as a solution to present-day concerns about law and order, the social history of the Bobby has rarely been explored. Yet his story (and since the beginning of the twentieth century it is also her story) is as exciting as that of his military cousin, Tommy Atkins. Bobby served on the front line of what is often characterized as 'the war against crime.' He may rarely have fought in pitched battles and almost never with lethal weapons, but his life could be hard and dangerous. Up until the last third of the twentieth century he usually patrolled on foot, in all weathers by day and, more often, by night. The drudgery of the foot patrol fostered that other nickname, 'Mr Plod'; something that may, or may not, have passed Enid Blyton by when she chose the name for the policeman of Noddy's Toytown. The period covered by The Great British Bobby saw massive economic, social and political change in Britain. The policing institution has shifted significantly in tandem, from having its primary relationship directly with the decentralized, local community, to becoming an instrument of the central state with, at the beginning of the twenty-first century, targets set and regulated centrally for the good of what politicians and policing professionals consider as the national community. Criminological expert Clive Emsley is ideally placed to tell the story of this remarkable and iconic institution; his book is nothing less than a social history of Britain over the last 180 years.", 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'id': 'uvMoAQAAIAAJ', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=uvMoAQAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=uvMoAQAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api'}, 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=uvMoAQAAIAAJ&dq=18th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'authors': ['Clive Emsley']}, {'categories': ['History'], 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=oldRGSQSR9YC&dq=18th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'publisher': 'African Books Collective', 'subtitle': 'From Mission Beginnings to Province of Ghana', 'title': 'The Anglican Story in Ghana', 'description': "The Anglican Church, by virtue of being the Christian communion most closely tied to the colonial history of the West Africa sub continent, could be said to be the oldest historic mission ecclesial body within the region.

The volume highlights the dynamics of Muslim traditions of reform in pre-colonial, colonial and post-colonial Zanzibar, focussing on the contribution of Sufi scholars (Q diriyya, Alawiyya) as well as Muslim reformers (modernists, activists, an r al-sunna) to Islamic education. It examines several types of Islamic schools (Qur nic schools, mad ris and Islamic institutes ) as well as the emergence of the discipline of Islamic Religious Instruction in colonial government schools. The volume argues that dynamics of cooperation between religious scholars and the British administration defined both form and content of Islamic education in the colonial period (1890-1963). The revolution of 1964 led to the marginalization of established traditions of Islamic education and encouraged the development of Muslim activist movements which have started to challenge state informed institutions of learning.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9789004175426', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=P-PipSRWCOMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=P-PipSRWCOMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '9004175423', 'pageCount': 643, 'authors': ['Roman Loimeier'], 'id': 'P-PipSRWCOMC'}, {'categories': ['Antiques & Collectibles'], 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=ynveAgAAQBAJ&dq=18th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'publisher': 'Harriman House Limited', 'subtitle': 'A Handbook for the Adventurous Collector', 'title': '101 Extraordinary Investments - Curious, Unusual and Bizarre Ways to Make Money', 'description': 'Finance.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9781906659257', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ynveAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ynveAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '1906659257', 'pageCount': 306, 'authors': ['Toby Walne'], 'id': 'ynveAgAAQBAJ'}, {'categories': ['History'], 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=NmfaPICwr3MC&dq=18th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'publisher': 'Sussex Academic Press', 'subtitle': 'From Salonica to Paris : the Story of a Sephardic Family in the Twentieth Century', 'title': 'Vidal and His Family', 'description': 'Edgar Morin, one of France\'s greatest living intellectuals, tells the story of his father, Vidal Nahoum, but also the story of Sephardic Jews, and of Europe. In this \'holographic history\' Vidal\'s story, and that of his family, carries within it the flowering, decline, and death of Jewish culture in Spain, the passage from Empires to Nation States, the complex relations between Jews and Gentiles, between East and West, and, ultimately, the history of the twentieth century itself. Morin\'s work ranges from the great sweep of global historical events to the everyday details of individual lives, letters, feelings, reflections, and experiences. Vidal was born in 1894 in the Ottoman Empire\'s great Macedonian port. His great-grandfather came from Tuscany and spoke Italian. His mother tongue was fifteenth-century Spanish. He learned French and German as a child. When he was an adolescent, he dreamed of living in France; he was deported there as a prisoner, and then liberated by the French Prime Minister. He lived through the Balkan wars, the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, and two World Wars. Vidal cannot be isolated from his family. And as Edgar Morin explains, "this book also tells the stories of the men and women in his immediate family When, as his son, I inevitably come into his story... I describe him as objectively as possible. The reverence that inspired me did not call for a work of edification; it implied that I should attempt to write a truthful book. For this reason, the book is not in the least respectful, or at least not in the usual sense of the word. Vidal felt that loving someone meant being able to tease him. The author of these lines, who has inherited something of this trait, does not think it disrespectful to tease or make fun of the people he loves."', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9781845192747', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NmfaPICwr3MC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NmfaPICwr3MC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '1845192745', 'pageCount': 330, 'authors': ['Edgar Morin'], 'id': 'NmfaPICwr3MC'}, {'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'authors': ['Oxford Gentleman Of Pembroke College'], 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=GK2qcQAACAAJ&dq=18th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'ISBN_13': '9781170896174', 'ISBN_10': '1170896170', 'pageCount': 40, 'publisher': 'Gale ECCO, Print Editions', 'subtitle': 'Or the Old Ballad of the Happy Shepherdess Paraphrased.

Their sheer chances of survival, their protection from want, their social status, their individual agency and their self-esteem were all strongly mediated by the family, the predominant social institution.

Within families, there were strong differences in autonomy, status and freedom between the genders and generations. The book offers a fascinating exploration of gender differences in well-being in many regions of historic Europe, with some comparative perspectives.

The generations that followed came to regard the force in which he served as 'the best police in the world'. If twenty-first century observers sometimes take a more jaundiced view of his efforts, the blue-helmeted, unarmed policeman remains an icon of Britishness, and a symbol of the relatively peaceful nature of our social evolution. In The Great British Bobby, Clive Emsley traces the development of Britain's forces of law and order from the earliest watchmen and constables of the pre-modern period to the police service of today. He examines in detail such milestones in police history as the establishment of the Bow Street Runners in the 1740s, the Police Acts of 1839, the introduction of women police officers during the First World War, and the Macpherson Report of 1999 into the death of Stephen Lawrence. Threaded through his narrative are case-studies of real-life Bobbies, drawn from police archives, evoking the day-to-day reality of the policeman's lot over two and a half centuries: the boredom of patrolling on foot in all weathers, the threats to life and limb of policing rough areas, and the diverse historical challenges of industrial unrest, the growth of cities, the arrival of the motor car and the ethnic diversification of society. From Robert Grubb, patrolling the mean streets of Georgian London with rattle and cudgel, to Norwell Roberts, the first black officer to be appointed to the Metropolitan Police, The Great British Bobby presents a cast of mostly honest coppers performing a testing role to the best of their ability. A distinguished historian and criminologist, Clive Emsley is ideally placed to tell - candidly but affectionately - the fascinating story of Britain's police force. The Great British Bobby is nothing less than a social history of Britain over the last 250 years, viewed through the prism of one of its most remarkable and distinctive institutions.", 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9781849161978', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=DQ1uQgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=DQ1uQgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '1849161976', 'pageCount': 336, 'authors': ['Clive Emsley'], 'id': 'DQ1uQgAACAAJ'}, {'categories': ['Australia'], 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=HKnLYNqQECsC&dq=18th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'publisher': 'Federation Press', 'subtitle': 'The Australian Military and Civil Unrest : the Legal and Constitutional Issues', 'title': 'Calling Out the Troops', 'description': 'A recognised expert on military call-out law, Associate Professor Michael Head, examines the troop call-out legislation introduced in 2000 and 2006, and reviews the ongoing Constitutional and legal uncertainties.

Previously known as 'Building the 21st Century Home', the second edition of this successful text describes the way that environmental and demographic change, economic pressures and the needs of community could change urban areas forever just as the garden city movement did a century ago. Some of the arguments that were so contentious ten years ago are now widely accepted. Others rumble on, particularly after another property crash that has hit urban apartments. The central point, however, remains; urban renaissance will not be achieved by coercion but by the creation of positive urban models. Through case studies, the book describes one such model, the Sustainable Urban Neighbourhood: mixed-use, mediumdensity urban development, designed to minimise resource use and maximise community. This classic text will be essential reading for urban designers, architects and planners, and anyone involved in the development of new homes and the regeneration of towns and cities. * Links social, environmental and economic factors with urban design for a fresh approach * Grounded in practical realities of development. Visionary, whilst also putting theory into practice * Provides a model for sustainable reform by showing how architects work with existing planning laws and environments to improve site plans", 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9780750656337', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=f-CfIc499xYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=f-CfIc499xYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '0750656336', 'pageCount': 315, 'authors': ['David Rudlin', 'Nicholas Falk'], 'id': 'f-CfIc499xYC'}, {'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'pageCount': 68, 'ISBN_13': '9781170181157', 'ISBN_10': '1170181155', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=4L0UcAAACAAJ&dq=18th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'publisher': 'Gale ECCO, Print Editions', 'authors': ['Nahum Tate'], 'title': 'The History of King Lear, Acted at the Queens Theatre Revived with Alterations by N Tate', 'description': 'The 18th century was a wealth of knowledge, exploration and rapidly growing technology and expanding record-keeping made possible by advances in the printing press.

It sheds new light on the seemingly erotic overtones in settings of the Song of Songs and dialogues between Christ and the faithful soul in late 17th- and early 18th-century cantatas by Heinrich SchYtz, Dieterich Buxtehude, and Johann Sebastian Bach. While these compositions have been interpreted solely as a secularizing tendency within devotional music of the baroque period, Isabella van Elferen demonstrates that they need to be viewed instead as intensifications of the sacred. Based on a wide selection of previously unedited or translated 17th- and 18th-century sources, van Elferen describes the history and development of baroque poetic and musical love discourses, from SchYtz's early works through Buxtehude's cantatas and Bach's cantatas and Passions. This long and multilayered discursive history of these compositions considers the love poetry of Petrarch, European reception of petrarchan imagery and traditions, its effect on the madrigal in Germany, and the role of Catholic medieval mystics in baroque Lutheranism. Van Elferen shows that Bach's compositional technique, based on the emotional characteristics of text and music rather than on the depiction of single words, allows the musical expression of mystical love to correspond closely to contemporary literary and theological conceptions of this affect.", 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9780810862210', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=4t0scnPSPUgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=4t0scnPSPUgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '0810862212', 'pageCount': 384, 'authors': ['Isabella van Elferen'], 'id': '4t0scnPSPUgC'}, {'categories': ['Social Science'], 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=rpnzBgAAQBAJ&dq=18th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'publisher': 'Cambridge Scholars Publishing', 'title': 'Modernity at the Beginning of the 21st Century', 'description': 'Modernity is back on sociology\'s agenda. From the beginnings of sociology as an academic discipline, questions surrounding the meaning and consequences of modernity have fascinated generations of sociologists. The initial interest in the concept was inspired by a sense of a deep rupture (and crisis) afflicting European society, a sense that society was approaching something fundamentally different from the past, an entirely new form of societal organization that bore little resemblance to anything known before. Where exactly this transformation was headed was by no means clear, but around the 18th century a growing number of European intellectuals and scholars realized that the changes that had been in the making since the late 15th century were irreversible and could not be contained in any particular region or confined to particular sectors of society, but would ultimately transform all spheres of life. Like other thinkers, sociologists observed this transformation with awe, and their attitude towards it has always been ambivalent. The 20th century, during which modernity gradually began to break through globally, was also a century during which many sociologists became increasingly disillusioned with the promises of "the modern project". But with the exhaustion of the energies of "postmodernism", the intellectual movement that wanted to bury modernity, the interest in modernity began to resurface again; not least because it became increasingly clear that the world is far from approaching a societal condition pointing systematically beyond modernity. Instead, we are witnessing an intensification of modernization processes around the world. But what is modernity, anyway? The aim of the present volume is to contribute to the ongoing discussion about the meaning of modernity and about the significance of modernization processes in non-Western societies. As befits a subject matter as controversial and complex at this one, the book\'s chapters offer no conclusive answers to the questions they raise and address. The debate about modernity must and will continue, and one hopes that it will be conducted in an atmosphere of mutual respect despite sometimes fierce disagreement between the participants. For only if we listen to each other can we make genuine intellectual progress.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9781443802253', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=rpnzBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=rpnzBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '1443802255', 'pageCount': 235, 'authors': ['Volker Schmidt'], 'id': 'rpnzBgAAQBAJ'}, {'categories': ['Science'], 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=S-PT6rXVL7oC&dq=18th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'publisher': 'A&amp;C Black', 'subtitle': 'A Photographic Guide', 'title': 'British Moths and Butterflies', 'description': "Packed with the stunning photography of Chris Manley, this new photographic guide is the perfect guide to Britain's moths and butterflies.

This volume approaches the ‘life cycle’ of linguistic variability in English using data sources that range from electronic corpora to the internet. In the spirit of the 1968 Weinreich, Labov and Herzog classic, the fifteen contributions divide into three sections, each highlighting different stages in the dynamics of English across time and space. They show, first, how increase in variability can be initiated by processes that give rise to new patterns of discourse, which can ultimately crystallize into new grammatical elements. The next phase is the spread of linguistic features and patterns of discourse, both new and well established, through the social and regional varieties of English. The final phase in this ebb and flow of linguistic variability consists of processes promoting some variable features over others across registers and regional and social varieties, thus resulting in reduced variation and increased linguistic homogeneity.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9789027290380', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=3e45AAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=3e45AAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '9027290385', 'pageCount': 339, 'authors': ['Terttu Nevalainen', 'Irma Taavitsainen', 'Päivi Pahta', 'Minna Korhonen'], 'id': '3e45AAAAQBAJ'}, {'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'authors': ['Susanna Centlivre'], 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=3TPJbwAACAAJ&dq=18th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'ISBN_13': '9781170181621', 'ISBN_10': '1170181627', 'pageCount': 82, 'publisher': 'Gale ECCO, Print Editions', 'subtitle': "A Comedy.

In 1750 he was called to a chair ‘‘Cameral Sciences and Rhetorics’’ at the new Theresian Academy of Knights in Vienna. There, he gave two important inaugural lectures which are the focal point of this book. In 1754, Justi was appointed a mineral counsellor in Gottingen ̈ (Hanover), and lectured at the Saxonian University on both state sciences and natural sciences. In 1762, Frederic II (the Great) of Prussia appointed him Prussian captain (highest supervisory position) of mines and general supervisor of fiscal-mineral activities. In 1768 he was accused of embezzlement, and before he could prove his innocence, he died in 1771 as a prisoner in the (decaying) fortress of Ku ̈ strin. Due to his death, the case was never decided. But Frederic had obviously made his own decision. When he appointed Justi, the appointee pointed out that he was suffering from weak eye sight and could not readily check the bookkeeping.

Leonardo has often been described as the archetype of the Renaissance man, a man whose unquenchable curiosity was equaled only by his powers of invention. He is widely considered to be one of the greatest painters of all time and perhaps the most diversely talented person ever to have lived. According to art historian Helen Gardner, the scope and depth of his interests were without precedent and "his mind and personality seem to us superhuman, the man...

He became an innovative, influential leader and spokesperson for First Nations, whose support for Britain during the American Revolution led to their resettlement in Upper Canada along the Grand River. Their descendants live today on the large Six Nations Reserve alongside the Grand, south of Brantford in southwestern Ontario. This new, illustrated biography of Brant reflects recent research into the political, social and cultural background of his life. Author James Paxton rejects the interpretation of earlier biographers, who depicted Brant as a man who belonged neither to the "Indian" or the "white" world. Paxton shows that Brant was fully Mohawk, with Iroquoian values that stressed the interdependence of people. He stands as the product of a unique, multicultural 18th-century community in the Mohawk Valley, New York. Using skill and diplomacy and his dense network of relationships and alliances, Brant attempted to ensure the ongoing social, economic and political autonomy of the Six Nations in their new Canadian territory. The events of Brant\'s day impinge directly on our own. It would be hard to imagine the standoff at Caledonia had Brant not led the Six Nations to the Grand River area and then invited Loyalists to settle among them. Yet, in 1784, Mohawks and Loyalists envisioned a different sort of community, one bound by history, common interest and shared practices. At a time when First Nations\' claims against the government promise to become more numerous and confrontational, this book encourages us to consider the inclusive and multicultural legacy of Joseph Brant.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9781552770238', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=bZQCAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=bZQCAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '1552770230', 'pageCount': 96, 'authors': ['James Paxton'], 'id': 'bZQCAgAAQBAJ'}, {'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'authors': ['Fanny Burney', 'Frances Burney'], 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=5z1wcgAACAAJ&dq=18th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'ISBN_13': '9781170858998', 'ISBN_10': '1170858996', 'pageCount': 306, 'publisher': 'Gale ECCO, Print Editions', 'subtitle': 'Or, a Picture of Youth. by the Author of Evelina and Cecilia. in Five Volumes.

Nineteenth-century phrenologists insisted that criminality was innate, a trait inherent in the offender’s brain matter. While they were eventually repudiated as pseudo-scientists and self-deluded charlatans, today the pendulum has swung back. Both criminologists and biologists have begun to speak of a tantalizing but disturbing possibility: that criminality may be inherited as a set of genetic deficits that place one at risk for theft, violence, and sexual deviance. If that is so, we may soon confront proposals for genetically modifying “at risk” fetuses or doctoring up criminals so their brains operate like those of law-abiding citizens. In The Criminal Brain, well-known criminologist Nicole Rafter traces the sometimes violent history of these criminological theories and provides an introduction to current biological theories of crime, or biocriminology, with predictions of how these theories are likely to develop in the future. What do these new theories assert? Are they as dangerous as their forerunners, which the Nazis and other eugenicists used to sterilize, incarcerate, and even execute thousands of supposed “born” criminals? How can we prepare for a future in which leaders may propose crime-control programs based on biology? Enhanced with fascinating illustrations and written in lively prose, The Criminal Brain examines these issues in light of the history of ideas about the criminal brain. By tracing the birth and growth of enduring ideas in criminology, as well as by recognizing historical patterns in the interplay of politics and science, she offers ways to evaluate new theories of the criminal brain that may radically reshape ideas about the causes of criminal behavior.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9780814776568', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=GK1PKyvkUhoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=GK1PKyvkUhoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '0814776566', 'pageCount': 352, 'authors': ['Nicole Rafter'], 'id': 'GK1PKyvkUhoC'}, {'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=nAlncgAACAAJ&dq=18th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'averageRating': 4.0, 'publisher': 'Gale ECCO, Print Editions', 'subtitle': 'Or, the Nature and Excellency of the Christian Religion.

Meserve concludes in his work An Outline History of American Drama that many eighteenth century American plays “indicate little dramatic talent and were written more to criticize and to propagandize than to create a work of art, but the passion of some exhibited in these plays often strikes a spark of real life“ (38). Given this, Meserve portrays early American drama as a weapon with the ambition to educate its readers in a specific (American) way. In the same breath, this also means that the play ́s form and its dramatic elements are less important than its implicit (political) message, which leads to the conclusion that early American drama is merely a political mouthpiece. Contrariwise, this paper will show that besides educating its readers, early American plays should also be read as a work of art. This will be illustrated by Royall Tyler ́s play The Contrast which is an outstanding example of the eighteenth century literature, combining political issues with formidable art. In summary, the overall question that will be answered in this study is: Which political issues of his time does Tyler portray in his comedy and which other readings of the play are possible? I assume that the political tendency is only one aspect. Above all, the paper will point out that the play is also construction of art and shows a special concept of utopia.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9783640161485', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=QyJzt2XqDJMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=QyJzt2XqDJMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '3640161483', 'pageCount': 12, 'authors': ['Sebastian Zilles'], 'id': 'QyJzt2XqDJMC'}, {'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'pageCount': 24, 'ISBN_13': '9781170998793', 'ISBN_10': '1170998798', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=cCDSbwAACAAJ&dq=18th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'publisher': 'Gale ECCO, Print Editions', 'authors': ['Gilbert Tennent'], 'title': "A Sermon Preach'D at Philadelphia, July 20 1748 on a Funeral Occasion, Wherein the Absolute Certainty, and Great Moment, of the Doctrine of the Resu", 'description': 'The 18th century was a wealth of knowledge, exploration and rapidly growing technology and expanding record-keeping made possible by advances in the printing press.

A glance at the index of each volume quickly reveals the extraordinary richness of the series’ total contents. Romantic Irony sets the broader experimental parameters of comparison by concentrating on the myriad expressions of “irony” as one of the major impulses in the Romantic philosophical and artistic revolution, and by combining cross-cultural and interdisciplinary studies with special attention also to literatures in less widely diffused language streams.

Romantic Poetry demonstrates deep patterns and a sharing of crucial themes of the revolutionary age which underlie the lyrical expression that flourished in so many languages and environments.

Written by one of the leading authorities on nautical history. It is difficult to pick up a modern nautical adventure series without at some point coming across a plot line that deals with "The Smugglers." Whether the hero of the story is "for \'em" or "again \'em," the plot lines will be there. But who were these smugglers? How did they become so successful? How did the King\'s Revenue Service try to stop them; and why was it all so important? E. Keble Chatterton has written the definitive book on this period. Working from old manuscripts, logs and journals, he has reconstructed the details of how it worked-and why it worked the way it did. Sometimes the King\'s cutters chased the smugglers-and sometimes the smugglers (literally) chased the King\'s cutters. Either way, it was a wild time in Britain\'s nautical history. The Fine Art of Smuggling is based on Chatterton\'s 1912 book: King\'s Cutters and Smugglers: 1700-1855, and is being reissued here as a Fireship Press Contemporized Classic.T With 33 Illustrations.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9781934757192', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=GsUznEZ-jFEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=GsUznEZ-jFEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '1934757195', 'pageCount': 256, 'authors': ['E.

In this dissertation the philosophical dimensions of characters in the novel are examined through the lens of three distinct eighteenth-century moral philosophers: Bernard Mandeville, Jeremy Bentham, and Immanuel Kant. Chapter One provides an overview of the socio-historical background of sixteenth-century Spain, and outlines the problems and challenges that marginalized citizens endured in a corrupt society. Attention is dedicated to the social and economic implications of poverty, the role of the Church, the consequences of Spain\'s administering of the New World, and the overlapping effects each of these had on sixteenth-century Spain. Chapter Two examines morals through the ideas of Bernard Mandeville and his most famous work The Fable of Bees: or, Private Vices, Publick Benefits (1723). The philosophical theory of Mandeville sustains the unusual idea that self-interested behavior can actually be good for the improvement of the overall society. Chapter Three examines the philosophy of Jeremy Bentham and focuses attention on his most famous work An Introduction to the Principle of Morals and Legislation (1789). Bentham was a utilitarian whose ideas concerned ways to maximize pleasure and minimize pain---"the greatest happiness for the greatest number of people." Chapter Four applies the views of Immanuel Kant to the first picaresque novel. My study focuses on Kant\'s most famous theory: the Categorical Imperative from his book the Groundwork for the Metaphysics of Morals (1785). Simply stated, Kant\'s area of inquiry was the mind, and his work maintains that behavior should be duty based with focus on the action, and not on any specific end. The Conclusion compares the 2000 cinematic adaptation Lazaro de Tormes with the novel on which it is based. My aim throughout this dissertation is to supplement existing research of Lazarillo and morals by connecting the novel to the major works of three notable moral philosophers of diverse thoughts and ideas.', 'id': 'pVvlqO9p4SEC'}, {'categories': ['Political Science'], 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=bpxTGYsPNwsC&dq=18th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'averageRating': 3.5, 'publisher': 'Penguin', 'subtitle': "Why You Can't Understand 21st-century Politics with an 18th-century Brain", 'title': 'The Political Mind', 'description': "A New York Times best-selling author explains how the physical nature of the brain affects people's political decisions, suggesting that changing one's mind is just as much a physical process as it is a psychological function.

Until very recently, the received view among linguists was that prescriptivism was a 'bad thing', something only worth considering in order to condemn it as a product of unenlightened thinking. The organisers wished to encourage participants to look at linguistic prescriptivism from a wide range of perspectives. Some of the main questions asked were: To what extent is the concept of prescriptivism to be considered a typical product of the 18&ltSUP>th century?

The 1777 Battle of Germantown brought the Revolutionary War to the village's doorsteps when George Washington's troops attacked the British. In the 19th century, when two railroad lines traversed Mount Airy, the old estates and farms gave way to a fresh grid of streets, fashionable new developments such as Pelham, and important institutions, including the Pennsylvania School for the Deaf.

The tour validated experience as an efficacious vehicle of refinement and erudition. The practice of connoisseurship, the ideological foundation of The Tour, predicated a refined moral sensibility on appreciation of art. The connoisseur's posture of disinterested and detached appreciation of the beautiful posited a universality of taste.

Does that make them even partly right? Or, more to the point, even a little interesting? Of course not. This unique look at history begins with an alternative Genesis as it were, elaborately recounting the birth of human civilization through the vehicle of ancient Egyptian deities, albeit in light of the most recent knowledge on arch?ology, anthropology, linguistics, sociology, comparative religion, political science, and general history. It moves quickly but seamlessly to Greece via Crete, revealing the relatively young age of Continental European (and thus all Western) culture, science, art, and religion, and their highly derivative nature?a point subtly repeated throughout this astonishingly wide-ranging work. As the title suggests, this is a book of contrasts, constantly comparing not only the Saints and the Sinners, but the East and the West, be the issues dealt with political or religious; in most cases, the one cannot be separated from the other. The phrase ?I come not to bring peace, but to bring a sword? certainly summarizes the history of mainline Christianity. But did Jesus even exist? And if he did, was he just re-enacting ancient myths and repeating old sayings? And what of Mohammed? Was he a false prophet, the Last Prophet, or just our for profit? The author does not presume to pass such judgement, only to relate the events as they happened, the facts as they stand, even if many of them are little known ones, conspicuous by their absence in standard school history books. He purports to offer a self-critique of Western culture by a cultured Westerner, a task made all the more challenging by the current, precarious world political situation. Factual without being dry, educational without being condescending, the Saints & Sinners debunks myths without destroying the mystery.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9789525700008', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=gVvcTx3jgXcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=gVvcTx3jgXcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '9525700003', 'pageCount': 798, 'authors': ['Antti P.

And knowing the why stems from an in-depth understanding of the underlying concepts and theoretical basis of electric circuits. Setting the benchmark for a modern approach to this fundamental topic, Nassir Sabah’s Electric Circuits and Signals supplies a comprehensive, intuitive, conceptual, and hands-on introduction with an emphasis on creative problem solving. A Professional Education Ideal for electrical engineering majors as a first step, this phenomenal textbook also builds a core knowledge in the basic theory, concepts, and techniques of circuit analysis, behavior, and operation for students following tracks in such areas as computer engineering, communications engineering, electronics, mechatronics, electric power, and control systems. The author uses hundreds of case studies, examples, exercises, and homework problems to build a strong understanding of how to apply theory to problems in a variety of both familiar and unfamiliar contexts. Your students will be able to approach any problem with total confidence. Coverage ranges from the basics of dc and ac circuits to transients, energy storage elements, natural responses and convolution, two-port circuits, Laplace and Fourier transforms, signal processing, and operational amplifiers. Modern Tools for Tomorrow’s Innovators Along with a conceptual approach to the material, this truly modern text uses PSpice simulations with schematic Capture® as well as MATLAB® commands to give students hands-on experience with the tools they will use after graduation. Classroom Extras When you adopt Electric Circuits and Signals, you will receive a complete solutions manual along with its companion CD-ROM supplying additional material.

It is set against the background of their private family lives, of developments in Senegalese society, and of global changes. While including female experts in spirit possession and plant-based healing, it also gives a rare insight in the work of women who offer Islamic knowledge such as Arabic astrology, numerology, divination and prayer sessions. With the analysis of marabout women's work this study sheds light on the ways in which women's authority in esoteric knowledge is negotiated, legitimated, and publicly recognised in Dakar. The study focuses especially upon marabout women's strategies to gain their clients' trust. Reference to rural areas is a significant element in this process. This study thus contributes to an understanding of the gendered way in which trust and scepticism are related to marabouts' work and of the role of a connection between Dakar and the rural areas therein.", 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9783825813499', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=YbmeNC7obAIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=YbmeNC7obAIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '3825813495', 'pageCount': 247, 'authors': ['Amber B.

This volume approaches the 'life cycle' of linguistic variability in English using data sources that range from electronic corpora to the internet. In the spirit of the 1968 Weinreich, Labov and Herzog classic, the fifteen contributions divide into three sections, each highlighting different stages in the dynamics of English across time and space. They show, first, how increase in variability can be initiated by processes that give rise to new patterns of discourse, which can ultimately crystallize into new grammatical elements. The next phase is the spread of linguistic features and patterns of discourse, both new and well established, through the social and regional varieties of English. The final phase in this ebb and flow of linguistic variability consists of processes promoting some variable features over others across registers and regional and social varieties, thus resulting in reduced variation and increased linguistic homogeneity.", 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9789027234827', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=L0lc2ti67FcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=L0lc2ti67FcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '9027234825', 'pageCount': 339, 'authors': ['Terttu Nevalainen'], 'id': 'L0lc2ti67FcC'}, {'categories': ['Biography & Autobiography'], 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=MgBozi63vRIC&dq=18th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'averageRating': 3.0, 'publisher': 'Vintage', 'subtitle': 'A True Tale of Forbidden Love in the 18th Century', 'title': 'A Venetian Affair', 'description': 'In the waning days of Venice’s glory in the mid-1700s, Andrea Memmo was scion to one the city’s oldest patrician families. At the age of twenty-four he fell passionately in love with sixteen-year-old Giustiniana Wynne, the beautiful, illegitimate daughter of a Venetian mother and British father. Because of their dramatically different positions in society, they could not marry. And Giustiniana’s mother, afraid that an affair would ruin her daughter’s chances to form a more suitable union, forbade them to see each other. Her prohibition only fueled their desire and so began their torrid, secret seven-year-affair, enlisting the aid of a few intimates and servants (willing to risk their own positions) to shuttle love letters back and forth and to help facilitate their clandestine meetings. Eventually, Giustiniana found herself pregnant and she turned for help to the infamous Casanova–himself infatuated with her. Two and half centuries later, the unbelievable story of this star-crossed couple is told in a breathtaking narrative, re-created in part from the passionate, clandestine letters Andrea and Giustiniana wrote to each other.

One member of the clan was Pálóczi Horváth Ádám, a staunch Hungarian patriot, collector of Hungarian folk songs at the turn of the 18th century, who believed that women should be entitled to an equal education with men, to the right to hold office and to have representatives in Parliament. His contemporary, Dukai Takách Judit was one of the first Hungarian female poets. Other illustrious members included writers, a diplomat, a state minister, and a mathematician. One fought in the Hungarian Revolution of 1848. Several died in the two world wars; many lived through the dismemberment of Hungary after World War I. The next generation made it through World War II, the Nazi occupation of the country, the Communist takeover of Eastern Europe, and the 1956 Hungarian Revolution. Many are still living in Hungary; others have left the country to seek better lives in England and America. Their personal stories bring alive the realities of life behind the headlines of history. The story of the family in the 20th century is told through the "portraits" of seven family members, spanning three generations. Pálóczi Horváth Lajos (author Dalma\'s father) was a writer, collector of folk songs (like Ádám) and champion of the rights of the peasants and industrial workers. He was a man of cosmopolitan education who spoke nine languages, but had a fierce loyalty to his country. He saw both Nazi Germany and Soviet Communism as equally dangerous to Hungary. After the Communist takeover of Hungary he was arrested on trumped up charges of subversion and served five years in prison. The freedom fighters of 1956 released him, but he did not leave his country even after the ruthless suppression of the 1956 Revolution. Hevesi Halász Laura, wife of Pálóczi Horváth Lajos and Dalma\'s mother, was born in the southern part of pre-World War I Hungary, an area assigned to Romania by the Treaty of Trianon. After World War I her widowed mother took the children to live in what was left of Hungary, and Laura lived through the privations and economic chaos caused by the dismemberment of the country. She was loyal to her husband, but in love with another man, Dálnoki Veress László, a Hungarian diplomat. During World War II Veress was charged by Hungary\'s Prime Minister to negotiate Hungary\'s surrender to the Allies. His "portrait" reveals the bittersweet complexities of this love triangle and its place in European history. Dalma\'s story shows how her life was shaped by these strong personalities and by the joys and cruelties of life in 20th century Europe and America. Together with her parents she made it through World War II and the siege of Budapest. For a month their house was in no man\'s land between the Russian and the German front lines. But the most traumatic part of the experience was the Russian occupation: for six weeks their home was an army hospital; the soldiers were the masters and the tenants were slaves obliged to obey their commands. Yet she also had the chance to learn much about the Soviet army because her father was the interpreter. In the years after 1945 hopes of a free country governed by free elections gradually faded. By 1947 the Communists were in control, arresting and imprisoning their opponents. Laura made the wrenching decision to leave Hungary with her daughter, and join Veress László, whom she later married. Dalma\'s story takes her through the challenges of starting a new life in England in the aftermath of World War II, preparing for exams, helping out at home while her mother and stepfather tried to make a living, and dreading news from Hungary where the Communists were gradually stifling all forms of freedom. She was 15 when she arrived in England. Seven years later she had a B.A. degree and teaching English in an English grammar school. But her challenges continued.

His rejection of Descartes\' \'innate ideas\' constituted the basis for the discussion about abilities and rights of women in the 18th century. A.R. Humphreys noted: "Throughout the century a skirmish went on between conservatives who argued for the grand principle of subordination and progressives, who, guided by the clear light of reason, contended for woman\'s rational and social equality."1 The married woman was considered to have neither rights nor property due to the fact that with the marriage all her property exchanged automatically to her husband. The ideal of marriage in the 18th century is described by W.L. Blease: " ... the ideal of marriage had been brought to its lowest possible level [...] it emphasized the sexual side of the connection, and almost entirely disregarded the spiritual."2 The average age for marrying rested with 17 years, which was the reason that most young women could not satisfy their positions as mothers. The only profession women could have was that of a wife and mother; as Blease said "A respectable woman was nothing but the potential mother of children."3. However, there was the problem of a surplus of women. Some women had the possibility to teach children, which was not very high regarded. Most women, however, had only the possibility to prostitute themselves which was a crucial problem of this times (Einhoff, 1980: 35). Terms like \'the fair sex\', \'the soft sex\' and \'the gentle sex\' designated the relationship of the sexes; the weak and tender woman needs to be protected by the st', 'id': 'HnmDu2kNrsoC'}, {'categories': ['Science'], 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=lw7lN8JibZsC&dq=18th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'publisher': 'Springer Science & Business Media', 'subtitle': 'Kinematics of Machines from the Renaissance to the 20th Century', 'title': 'The Machines of Leonardo Da Vinci and Franz Reuleaux', 'description': 'This fascinating book will be of as much interest to engineers as to art historians, examining as it does the evolution of machine design methodology from the Renaissance to the Age of Machines in the 19th century.

Especially tourist interest concentrates on these landmarks of Scotland, which are said to be insignias of Scottish tradition, glory and identity, and which dominate the image of Scotland. But are these landmarks really linked to a tradition from times immemorial? Do they really represent a link to Scotland\'s Gaelic roots? This paper will investigate this question by introducing Eric Hobsbawms term of "invented tradition" to denote and to outline the process of creation of these Scottish symbols. The following portrait of the historical background will show the social, political and economic developments in the 18th and 19th century which led to the invention of tradition as part of the creation of a Highland myth as a result of and as reaction to Scotland\'s union with England in 1707. Furthermore, the worldwide spreading of the Highland myth, which has determined the image of whole Scotland ever since, will be described. The paper will finish by showing contemporary parallels to the historic developments and trends, and suggesting further topics of investigation.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9783638816519', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_U-5sq5MDBQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_U-5sq5MDBQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '3638816516', 'pageCount': 64, 'authors': ['Marco Sievers'], 'id': '_U-5sq5MDBQC'}, {'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'pageCount': 66, 'ISBN_13': '9781170826188', 'ISBN_10': '1170826180', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=g0d_cgAACAAJ&dq=18th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'publisher': 'Gale ECCO, Print Editions', 'authors': ['Henry Jones'], 'title': 'The Earl of Essex a Tragedy As It Is Acted at the Theatre-Royal in Covent-Garden Written by Mr Henry Jones', 'description': 'The 18th century was a wealth of knowledge, exploration and rapidly growing technology and expanding record-keeping made possible by advances in the printing press.

Despite indications that the majority of Muslims desired political unification based on their Islamic heritage, the Party divided them into separate "nationalities" along narrow ethnic lines, incorporated most into the RSFSR, and attempted to uproot traditional Islamic institutions and customs under the aegis of class war. Resistance took the form of pan-Muslim nationalism, a reformist political conception with roots in the Near East. This conflict not only aborted the export of revolution to the Islamic world, contributing to the passing of the revolutionary era in Russia, but aided Stalin\'s rise to power.

Sometimes these articulators work in tandem to produce one lexical item while in other instances they operate to convey different types of information simultaneously.

However, this book is the first to offer a comprehensive treatment of this topic, presenting a collection of papers dealing with different aspects of simultaneity in a range of related and unrelated signed languages, in descriptive and cross-linguistic treatments which are set in different theoretical frameworks.

Spinoza\'s definition of love manifests a major paradigm shift achieved by seventeenth-century Europe, in which the emotions, formerly seen as normative "forces of nature," were embraced by the new science of the mind.This shift has often been seen as a transition from a philosophy laden with implicit values and assumptions to a more scientific and value-free way of understanding human action. But is this rational approach really value-free? Today we tend to believe that values are inescapable, and that the descriptive-mechanical method implies its own set of values. Yet the assertion by Spinoza, Malebranche, Leibniz, and Enlightenment thinkers that love guides us to wisdom-and even that the love of a god who creates and maintains order and harmony in the world forms the core of ethical behavior-still resonates powerfully with us. It is, evidently, an idea Western culture is unwilling to relinquish.This collection of insightful essays offers a range of interesting perspectives on how the triumph of "reason" affected not only the scientific-philosophical understanding of the emotions and especially of love, but our everyday understanding as well.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9789058676511', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=vMs5SxY7XukC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=vMs5SxY7XukC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '905867651X', 'pageCount': 269, 'authors': ['Gábor Boros', 'Herman De Dijn', 'Martin Moors'], 'id': 'vMs5SxY7XukC'}, {'categories': ['Political Science'], 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=s6jgZDxcftMC&dq=18th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'publisher': 'Walter de Gruyter', 'subtitle': 'America.

On the contrary, while Hogarth himself liked to project this image, his effective invention of British art was founded upon a profound knowledge of contemporary French art and theory. This lavishly illustrated book conjures up in great detail the French and wider European context within which Hogarth's art was formed. Robin Simon examines the ways in which Hogarth interacted with and influenced his contemporaries not only in painting and print-making, but also in sculpture, poetry, the novel, the theater, public life, art education, copyright law, music and opera. In this wide-ranging but richly detailed book, full of analyses of individual works, the author draws upon a mass of new material, with fresh analyses of Hogarth's most famous and less well-known works alike, opening a window on to one of the most creative and formative periods in British life. Robin Simon, FSA, is Editor of The British Art Journal, having been Editor of Apollo magazine and a tenured university academic for many years before that. He is the author of many scholarly articles on British art, and his books include The Portrait in Britain and America (1987).", 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9780955406300', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=IH_qAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=IH_qAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '0955406307', 'pageCount': 313, 'id': 'IH_qAAAAMAAJ'}, {'categories': ['Performing Arts'], 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=_lLoTsT2X5EC&dq=18th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'averageRating': 4.5, 'publisher': 'Human Kinetics', 'subtitle': 'An Interactive Arts Approach', 'title': 'History of Dance', 'description': "History of Dance: An Interactive Arts Approachprovides an in-depth look at dance from the dawn of time through the 20th century.

History of Dance: An Interactive Arts Approachhas four parts. Part Iexplains the tools used to capture dance from the past. Part IIbegins a chronological study of dance, beginning with its origins and moving through ancient civilizations and the Middle Ages through the Renaissance. Part IIIcovers dance from the 17th to the 20th century, including dance at court, dance from court to theater, romantic to classical ballet, and dance in the United States. Part IVfocuses on 20th-century American dance, highlighting influences on American ballet and modern dance as it emerged, matured, and evolved during that century. History of Dance: An Interactive Arts Approachincludes the following features: -Chapter outlines that present topics covered in each chapter -Opening scenarios to set the scene and introduce each time period -Explorations of dancers, choreographers, and other personalities -Explorations of the dances and significant choreography and dance literature of each time period -History Highlight boxes containing unusual facts, events, and details to bring history to life -History Trivia, providing insights into how dance relates to the history, art, and society of the time period -Web sites to encourage further exploration -Developing a Deeper Perspective sections that encourage students to use visual or aesthetic scanning, learn and perform period dances, observe and write performance reports, develop research projects and WebQuests (Internet-based research projects), and participate in other learning activities -Vocabulary terms at the end of each chapter Each chapter in parts II through IV provides an overview of the time period, including a time capsule and a historical and societal overview. Each chapter focuses on major dancers, choreographers, and personalities; dances of the period, including dance forms, dance designs, accompaniment, costuming, and performing spaces; and significant dance works and dance literature. The chapters also feature a series of eight experiential learning activities that help students dig deeper into the history of dance, dancers, and significant dance works and literature. These activities are presented as reproducible templates that include perceiving, creating, performing, writing, and presenting oral activities infused with technology. Teachers can use these activities as optional chapter assignments or as extended projects to help apply the information and to use technology and other integrated arts sources to make the history of dance more meaningful. History of Danceis an indispensable text for dance students who want to learn the history of dance and its relationship to other arts of the times using today's interactive technology.", 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9780736060356', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_lLoTsT2X5EC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_lLoTsT2X5EC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '0736060359', 'pageCount': 309, 'authors': ['Gayle Kassing'], 'id': '_lLoTsT2X5EC'}, {'categories': ['History'], 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=QlemwRTsY20C&dq=18th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'publisher': 'Infobase Publishing', 'title': 'Slavery in America', 'description': 'Presents the history of slavery in America from colonial times through the U.S. Civil War.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9781438108131', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=QlemwRTsY20C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=QlemwRTsY20C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '1438108133', 'pageCount': 561, 'authors': ['Dorothy Schneider', 'Carl J.

It elaborates a theory of collective identity as the dramatic or theatrical performance of a socially constructed collective Self that can be analyzed in three dimensions. The diachronic, or temporal, dimension is captured in the notions of historical meta-narratives and scripts. The two synchronic, or atemporal, dimensions are those of social space---anchored in the concepts of images and role-relationships---and physical space---further divisible into two ways of attaching importance to the physical setting for a given community. The empirical chapters of the dissertation examine a number of significant historical periods and cases. Two chapters look at Eastern and Latin Christendom from the Early to the High Middle Ages, two further chapters contain case studies of the writings of Martin Luther and Voltaire, and the last empirical chapter is a case study of debates in the European Parliament during the 1990s and early years of the 21st century. A concluding disscussion considers similarities and differences in how Turks and/or Saracens were represented in different epochs. The thesis argues that the generally hostile depictions of Muslims found in medieval writings on theology, historiography, and politics were part of struggles over the construction of a common Christian identity, upon which a secular European identity was eventually constructed. It further aims to illustrate how our understanding of the European Union's ambivalent posture toward Turkey can be advanced as a result of this historical investigation.", 'id': 'UH-1JHVZsLgC'}, {'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'authors': ['Robert Barclay'], 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=A64wcAAACAAJ&dq=18th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'ISBN_13': '9781170994771', 'ISBN_10': '1170994776', 'pageCount': 632, 'publisher': 'Gale ECCO, Print Editions', 'subtitle': 'Being a Full Explanation', 'title': 'An Apology for the True Christian Divinity, As the Same Is Held Forth, and Preached, by the People, Called in Scorn, Quakers', 'description': 'The 18th century was a wealth of knowledge, exploration and rapidly growing technology and expanding record-keeping made possible by advances in the printing press.

The concept of the oceans and navigable waters as held in public trust is examined from its origins in the 17th century North Sea fisheries controversy with particular regard to the arguments by Selden and Grotius pertaining to State jurisdiction over oceans and marginal sea areas. Those arguments manifest an underlying common principle of navigational freedom reflected in the parallel public trust development of public rights to fishing and navigation as protected and preserved within the Royal Prerogative "jus publicum," The significance for the modern context is that the 1958 Geneva Conventions on the Law of the Sea, the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and a myriad of other conventions now evidence an unstated but patent public trust in the communal responsibility of States within both the conventional and customary regime of the high seas, as well as in regimes for territorial seas and marginal sea areas as shared with extended coastal State jurisdictions.

Shuler'], 'title': 'Calling Out Liberty: Human Rights Discourse and Early American Literature', 'description': 'On September 9, 1739, a group of slaves armed themselves by breaking into a storehouse near the Stono River south of Charles Town, South Carolina. They burned houses, killed colonists, recruited other slaves to join them, and marched toward Spanish Florida where they expected to find freedom. One report of the incident claims the rebels were overheard shouting, "Liberty!" By mid-afternoon the rebellion had been crushed and many rebels executed. Shortly thereafter, South Carolina enacted a comprehensive legal code that placed strict controls over the ability of slaves to communicate with one another. The Stono Rebellion and its aftermath serve as a touchstone for this exploration of human rights discourse in early American literature. Building upon the many historical analyses of this rebellion, I suggest a relationship between the rebels shouts of "Liberty!" and the discourse of natural or human rights in the literary acts of African Americans. More often than not, human rights scholars and policy makers cite figures of the European Enlightenment as default sources for contemporary human rights. Certainly the Enlightenment fostered a human rights agenda, but its shortcomings---the abuse of the rights of women, children, and indigenous peoples, as well as the Atlantic slave trade---sullied this agenda. Therefore, this project suggests ways of altering and enriching our understanding of the origins of contemporary human rights discourse. John Locke\'s philosophy of natural rights and his ambiguous political and economic ties to the colony of South Carolina, serve as a starting point for an analysis of manifestations of eighteenth century human rights discourse in the work of Benjamin Lay, Thomas Jefferson, Thomas Paine, and others. I offer a close reading of the rebellion and its legal repercussions followed by an examination of representations of human rights discourse in early African American prose (Olaudah Equiano, Prince Hall, Omar ibn Said) and fiction (Frederick Douglass and Martin Delany). Finally, I assess the intertextual challenge to this discourse offered by the Charleston School and the competing plantation traditions of Thomas Nelson Page and Edmund Quincy.', 'id': 'A4Z7OZM6Ec8C'}, {'categories': ['Family & Relationships'], 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=0E-z2N2wzGoC&dq=18th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'publisher': 'Greenwood Publishing Group', 'title': 'Family Life in 20th-century America', 'description': 'Presents an overview and analysis of the social changes that have occurred in family life in the last one hundred years, discussing such issues as new attitudes toward marriage and divorce, the development of new gender roles, the transformation of work,and the rise of alternative families.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9780313333569', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=0E-z2N2wzGoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=0E-z2N2wzGoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '0313333564', 'pageCount': 324, 'authors': ['Marilyn Coleman', 'Lawrence H.

Pocket sized 5" x 7" and with a new foreword by Llewellyn H. Rockwell, Jr. Here is the revolutionary book on monetary reform brilliant, compelling, clear, with specific reforms to do now in an edition for global distribution. See the price. And the format is really a pocket edition edition: extremely small format that is super convenient. This edition is specifically designed to be purchased in large quantities. Had the U.S. followed the recommendations of this wonderful report when it came out in 1982, there would have been no housing bubble, no gigantic government debt, no depression, no economic upheaval, no high unemployment, and no international turmoil. This was a window of opportunity for reform. This is proof that Ron was right. In 1982, Ron Paul served on the U.S. Gold Commission to evaluate the role of gold in the monetary system. In fact, the Commission was his idea. It was carrying forth a promise made in the Republican platform. Back then, Republicans at least made noises about favoring a gold standard based on a gold dollar. Ron couldnt pick the members, so from the beginning, the deck was stacked. The majority was dominated by monetarists, who saw gold as too scarce and paper as just fine. Ron Pauls team was ready, however, with this marvelous minority report. Rarely has a dissent on a government commission done so much good. The result was The Case for Gold, and it was the greatest result of the commission. It covers the history of gold in the United States, explains that its breakdown was caused by governments, and explains the merit of having sound money: prices reflect market realities, government stays in check, and the people retain their freedom. The recommendations include re establishing a gold standard and a gold dollar in addition to permitting monetary competition and the private production of moneys. The scholarship and rigor impressed even the critics of the minority. Ron and Lewis Lehrman worked with a team of economists that included Murray Rothbard, so it is hardly surprising that such a book would result. It still holds up as an excellent blueprint for moving beyond paper money and into the age of sound money. In particular, Ron favors complete monetary freedom to use any commodity as money, to make contracts in any money, and an end to the monopolization and printing power of the Federal Reserve. There is a strong piece of history in this book. Not since the 19th century has a political figure made such a sweeping and devastating case for radical monetary reform.

Yet while the average citizen is bombarded with information about a few sensational cases--such as the multi-million dollar damages awarded a woman who burned herself with McDonald's coffee-- most Americans are unaware of the truly dramatic transformation our courts and judicial system have undergone over the past three decades, and of the need to reform the system to adapt to that transformation. In Reforming the Civil Justice System, Larry Kramer has compiled a work that charts these revolutionary changes and offers solutions to the problems they present. Organized into three parts, the book investigates such topics as settlement incentives and joint tortfeasors, substance and form in the treatment of scientific evidence after Daubert v. Merrell Dow, and guiding jurors in valuing pain and suffering damages. Reforming the Civil Justice System offers feasible solutions that can realistically be adopted as our civil justice system continues to be refined and improved.", 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9780814757154', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=hOCAQre9RQEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=hOCAQre9RQEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '0814757154', 'pageCount': 253, 'authors': ['James Marten'], 'id': 'hOCAQre9RQEC'}, {'categories': ['Social Science'], 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=aRnpAgAAQBAJ&dq=18th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'publisher': 'LIT Verlag Münster', 'subtitle': 'Strategies of Multinational Oil Companies, States, and Ethnic Minorities : Impact on Environment, Livelihoods, and Cultural Change', 'title': 'Fossil Fuels, Oil Companies, and Indigenous Peoples', 'description': 'This book is a study of oil production that focuses on the places from which oil is extracted, and on the problems, both environmental and human, created in those places.

In bringing together leading historians working on Southern Europe, the Balkans, and the Ottoman Empire for the first time, it builds bridges across national historiographies, raises a number of comparative questions and unveils unexplored intellectual connections and ideological formulations. The book shows that in the so-called age of nationalism the idea of the nation state was by no means dominant, as displaced intellectuals and migrant communities developed notions of double national affiliations, imperial patriotism and liberal imperialism. By adopting the Mediterranean as a framework of analysis, the collection offers a fresh contribution to the growing field of transnational and global intellectual history, revising the genealogy of 19th-century nationalism and liberalism, and reveals new perspectives on the intellectual dynamics of the age of revolutions.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9781472576651', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=y-iKoAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=y-iKoAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '1472576659', 'pageCount': 256, 'authors': ['Maurizio Isabella', 'Konstantina Zanou'], 'id': 'y-iKoAEACAAJ'}, {'categories': ['Political Science'], 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=xdPOCgAAQBAJ&dq=19th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'publisher': 'Routledge', 'subtitle': 'Global Economy in the Continuing Asian Age', 'title': 'Reorienting the 19th Century', 'description': 'Andre Gunder Frank was a path-breaking scholar in several disciplines over an illustrious and contentious 50-year career.

The book reveals the dark heart of the town and reflects not only the poverty and squalor in which many people of the time lived, but also the deep-rooted prejudices and double standards of the period. Crimes include poaching in the local area, a serious poisoning of bread and butter pudding at an eating house and the tragic story of a man who was poisoned for a joke. More sinister happenings include a case of body snatching, which brought the whole town of Barnsley to a state of complete panic, the distressing murder of a child, and a woman who was shot down in the street by her former marine boyfriend. The book also charts cases of attempted murder, including the story of a woman who was saved from death by her stays and a brutal attack on an elderly lady, which might so easily have ended in murder. These macabre tales reveal a side of Barnsley that is not visible in the modern town of today. The intriguing narrative and in-depth coverage of Barnsley's criminal past make this essential reading for both local historians and those interested in true crime.", 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9781473827356', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=jyMeCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=jyMeCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '1473827353', 'pageCount': 160, 'authors': ['Margaret Drinkall'], 'id': 'jyMeCgAAQBAJ'}, {'categories': ['History'], 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=5tN0CgAAQBAJ&dq=19th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'publisher': 'BRILL', 'subtitle': 'Old Stones versus Modern Identities', 'title': 'Destruction of Cultural Heritage in 19th-century France', 'description': 'Destruction of Cultural Heritage in 19th Century France charts the destruction of earlier architecture as towns pull down their walls, build modern houses, welcome railways and, except for a few scholars, forget about the past.

Emphasizing dynamic rather than structural factors, the essays thus move beyond earlier studies of family history. Essays by the editors, Richard Easterlin, George Alter, Gretchen Condran, and Stanley Engerman focus on patterns of fertility in relation to urban and industrial development, economic opportunity and the availability of land, and race and ethnic origin. The remaining essays, by Laurence Glasco, Howard Chudacoff, and John Modell, deal with family organization over time as affected by such factors as the practice of boarding, the role of kin, family budgeting strategy, and migration. The authors not only challenge the prevailing assumption that rapid urbanization is responsible for the decline in the fertility rate; they also contend that, contrary to the prevailing theories of social change, the emergence of nuclear households was not a consequence of industrialization.

Family life with two children--in many ways as difficult as modern offspring--is brought vividly to life and the below-stairs relationships of the servants are poignantly recorded. The evening social whirl of visits to theaters and supper parties is chronicled, and the description of seaside holidays on the Kentish coast, when Margate was in vogue, portrays the social niceties of promenades and dances.

To many, the science of that turbulent age appeared to offer bright new answers to life\'s age-old questions. Such a climate, not surprisingly, fostered the growth of what we now view as "pseudo-sciences" -- disciplines delicately balancing a dubious inductive methodology with moral and spiritual concerns, disseminated with a combination of aggressive entrepreneurship and sheer entertainment. Such "sciences" as mesmerism, spiritualism, homoeopathy, hydropathy, and phrenology were warmly received not only by the uninformed and credulous but also by the respectable and educated. Rationalistic, egalitarian, and utilitarian, they struck familiar and reassuring chords in American ears and gave credence to the message of reformers that health and happiness are accessible to all. As the contributors to this volume show, the diffusion and practice of these pseudo-sciences intertwined with all the major medical, cultural, religious, and philosophical revolutions in nineteenth-century America. Hydropathy and particularly homoeopathy, for example, enjoyed sufficient respectability for a time to challenge orthodox medicine. The claims of mesmerists and spiritualists appeared to offer hope for a new moral social order. Daring flights of pseudo-scientific thought even ventured into such areas as art and human sexuality. And all the pseudo-sciences resonated with the communitarian and women\'s rights movements. This important exploration of the major nineteenth-century pseudo-sciences provides fresh perspectives on the American society of that era and on the history of the orthodox sciences, a number of which grew out of the fertile soil plowed by the pseudo-scientists.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9780813165035', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=McsfBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=McsfBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '0813165032', 'pageCount': 256, 'authors': ['Arthur Wrobel'], 'id': 'McsfBgAAQBAJ'}, {'categories': ['Literary Criticism'], 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=BPemBgAAQBAJ&dq=19th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'publisher': 'Cambridge Scholars Publishing', 'title': 'The Grotesque in the Fiction of Charles Dickens and Other 19th-century European Novelists', 'description': 'This book provides an overview of the literary grotesque in 19th-century Europe, with special emphasis on Charles Dickens, whose use of this complex aesthetic category is thus addressed in relation with other 19th-century European writers. The crossing of geographical boundaries allows an in-depth study of the different modes of the grotesque found in 19th-century fiction. It provides a comprehensive analysis of the reasons behind the extensive use of such a favoured mode of expression. Intertextuality and comparative or cultural analysis are thus used here to shed new light on Dickens’s influences (both given and received), as well as to compare and contrast his use of the grotesque with that of key 19th-century writers like Hugo, Gogol, Thackeray, Hardy and a few others. The essays of this volume examine the various forms taken by the grotesque in 19th-century European fiction, such as, for example, the fusion of the familiar and the uncanny, or of the terrifying and the comic; as well as the figures and narrative techniques best suited for the expression of a novelist’s grotesque vision of the world. These essays contribute to an assessment of the links between the grotesque, the gothic and the fantastic, and, more generally, the genres and aesthetic categories which the 19th-century grotesque fed on, like caricature, the macabre and tragicomedy. They also examine the novelists’ grotesque as contributing to the questioning of society in Victorian Britain and 19th-century Europe, echoing its raging conflicts and the shocks of scientific progress. This study naturally adopts as its theoretical basis the works of key theorists and critics of the grotesque: namely, Victor Hugo, Charles Baudelaire and John Ruskin in the 19th century, and Mikhail Bakhtin, Wolfgang Kayser, Geoffrey Harpham and Elisheva Rosen in the 20th century.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9781443874052', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=BPemBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=BPemBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '1443874051', 'pageCount': 250, 'authors': ['Isabelle Hervouet-Farrar', 'Max Vega-Ritter'], 'id': 'BPemBgAAQBAJ'}, {'categories': ['Social Science'], 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=upLgBQAAQBAJ&dq=19th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'publisher': 'ABC-CLIO', 'subtitle': 'A Comprehensive Encyclopedia of Issues, Events, and People', 'title': "Women's Rights in the United States", 'description': "Few realize that the origin of the discussion on women's rights emerged out of the anti-slavery movement of the 19th century, and that suffragists were active in the peace and labor movements long after the right to vote was granted.

Berwick was also the site of the country’s first sawmill, powered by the Salmon Falls River. In the 1800s, sawmills gave way to cotton mills, all which continued to depend on the river for their livelihood. In 1935, Berwick became the headquarters of Prime Tanning, which grew to be the country’s most dominant leather tannery. Today, Berwick is shifting its focus back to the river, not as a means to support factory life, but rather as a place to gather and engage in community activities.

Rosenberg highlights intersections between an emergent ethnographie musicale in France and narratives of musical encounter found in French travel literature, connecting both phenomena to France’s imperial aspirations and nationalist anxieties in the period from the Revolution to the late-nineteenth century.

Commemorating Writers in Nineteenth-Century Europe is the first volume to study this phenomenon in depth, offering both detailed accounts of the cults of individual writers and a comparative perspective on the spread of centenary fever across Europe. The result is fascinating insights into the interaction between performance, cultural memory and identity, and into the role of literature as a platform for both the negotiation of conflict and the celebration of common values. The comparative approach reveals how national identities were established along comparable lines in different countries, and how they were entangled in complex ways with struggles for power and prestige at local, regional and transnational levels. Among the fifteen cases studied, the English reader will encounter familiar names like Scott, Burns, Goethe, Dante, Petrarch, Cervantes and Camões, but also less familiar ones, such as Petőfi, Prešeren, and Vondel. This study offers a radically new perspective on the trans-European cult of literature in the nineteenth century and on its societal importance.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9781137412157', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=IElvBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=IElvBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '1137412151', 'pageCount': 320, 'authors': ['Joep Leerssen', 'Ann Rigney'], 'id': 'IElvBAAAQBAJ'}, {'categories': ['History'], 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=ABGJBAAAQBAJ&dq=19th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'publisher': 'ABC-CLIO', 'title': 'Health and Wellness in 19th-Century America', 'description': 'This book provides a comprehensive description of what being sick and receiving "medical care" was like in 19th-century America, allowing modern readers to truly appreciate the scale of the improvements in healthcare theory and practice.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9780313380457', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ABGJBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ABGJBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '0313380457', 'pageCount': 287, 'authors': ['John C.

In developed countries, increasingly people are choosing not to have children. The causes of this 'revolution' are many including the belief that to create a new life is to subject someone unnecessarily, and without their consent, to life's many sufferings including death. This belief and its underlying philosophy is known as anti-natalism. There has been a recent resurgence of this philosophy, with David Benatar's book Better Never To Have Been (2006) as a major catalyst. Anti-natalism can be seen as part of a broader philosophy, described here as Rejectionism, which finds existence -directly or indirectly, i.e. as procreation - as deeply problematic and unacceptable. The book traces the development of this philosophy from its ancient religious roots in Hinduism (Moksha) and Buddhism (Nirvana) to its most modern articulation by the South African philosopher David Benatar. It examines the contribution to rejectionist thought by Schopenhauer and von Hartmann in the 19th century and Zapffe, a little known Norwegian thinker, in the 20th century, and most recently by Benatar. Benatar and Zapffe represent this approach most clearly as anti-natalism. The book also devotes a chapter to the literary expression of rejectionist philosophy in the works of Samuel Beckett and J.P.Sartre. In sum, far from being an esoteric doctrine rejectionism has been a major presence in human history straddling all three major cultural forms - religious, philosophical and literary. The book argues that anti-natal philosophy and its practice owe a great deal to three major developments: secularization, liberalization of social attitudes, and technological advances (contraception). Anti-natal attitudes and practice should therefore be seen as a part of 'progress' in that these developments are widening our choice of lifestyles and attitudes to existence. In sum, The book argues that anti-natalism needs to be taken seriously and considered as a legitimate view of a modern, secular civilization. Secondly, the book seeks to situate current anti-natalist thought in its historical and philosophical perspective. Finally, it argues that in order to develop anti-natalism further it needs to be institutionalized as a form rational 'philosophy of life', and more attention needs to be paid to the problems and prospect of putting this philosophy into practice.", 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9781622875702', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_GolAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_GolAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '1622875702', 'pageCount': 170, 'authors': ['Ken Coates'], 'id': '_GolAwAAQBAJ'}, {'categories': ['Social Science'], 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=73IxBwAAQBAJ&dq=19th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'publisher': 'Cambridge Scholars Publishing', 'title': 'New Readings in Latin American and Spanish Literary and Cultural Studies', 'description': 'Presenting and interrogating an array of texts and discourses, this collection brings into focus a broad range of topics whose common denominator is the intersection between cultural productions and politics in different moments of the history of Latin America and Spain.

How did religious institutes function as cultural elites in the production and mediation of knowledge, ideologies, cultural codes, and practices? What kind of discursive and operational strategies did they use to help construct and propagate social Catholicism, ultramontanism, and confessionalism, and to establish and promote the Catholic communication system? What were the central mechanisms in the production of knowledge and how were they incorporated within identity politics? The volume also takes a broad perspective on the role of religious institutes in the production and propagation of religious, cultural, and social practices, and in the socialisation of the Catholic population.

The transatlantic chattel slave trade is the singular system-institution that has literally shaped the world economically, industrially, politically, technologically and theologically. On this foundation, contextualization is supremely significant to the study of the transatlantic chattel slave trade, social history, systematic theology, philosophy of religion, historical history and theology. The slave trade was not a congenial institution executed by the Royals, Churches, ie the ministers of religion, bishops, Archbishops, Intellectuals, theologians, philosophers of religion, Quakers, Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign parts, intellectuals, historians and scientists. It was rather the most egregious holocaust- genocide in man’s chronological history. The slave trade was motivated by profound cultural racism expressed in psychic distance psychologically by Britain. It was a nefarious and nefandous brutal system that defied imagination and rationality. DR. Milwood has unearthed the historical facts of historical distortions, intellectual suppression and historical falsification of facts practiced by Britain who was the pre-eminent protangonists in the brutal and profligate enslaved and murdered Black Atlantic slave trade. Using the study and tools of social history, systematic theology and historical history DR. Milwood now recognized how Britain consciously used de-contextualization and marginalization techniques to make recondite the profligate-ness of the horrendous transatlantic chattel slave trade in African bodies. What DR. Milwood finds most sardonic is that Britain used semantic cultural Christianity and messed up the biblical and theological concepts of Africans and African descendants. On top of this moral crime, Britain refused consistently to make Reparations to Africa and the Caribbean for crimes against humanity according to International Laws and Moral Christianity. DR. Milwood therefore has laid the foundation with historical veritable that the crimes committed by Britain demands an un-equivocal apology to black people and full Reparations for the nefarious, racial, avaricious and brutal crimes committed in the name of a white God and the apparition of a Caucasian Jesus Christ as Redeemer of the World without any historical evidence invented by Britain. For DR. Milwood, contextualization is the hermeneutic cadence-force and challenge to Britain’s de-contextualization and marginalization of the greatest holocaust- genocide crimes committed against Almighty God and humanity according to International Laws. Full Reparation from Britain is the only redemption and means for reconciliation and justice.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9781491894057', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=7yEKAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=7yEKAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '1491894059', 'pageCount': 320, 'authors': ['DR.

For reasons explained below, our discussion of twentieth-century mathematics ends with the 1930s. Our general objectives are identical with those stated in the preface to the three-volume edition, i. e. , we consider the development of mathematics not simply as the process of perfecting concepts and techniques for studying real-world spatial forms and quantitative relationships but as a social process as weIl. Mathematical structures, once established, are capable of a certain degree of autonomous development. In the final analysis, however, such immanent mathematical evolution is conditioned by practical activity and is either self-directed or, as is most often the case, is determined by the needs of society. Proceeding from this premise, we intend, first, to unravel the forces that shape mathe matical progress. We examine the interaction of mathematics with the social structure, technology, the natural sciences, and philosophy. Throughan anal ysis of mathematical history proper, we hope to delineate the relationships among the various mathematical disciplines and to evaluate mathematical achievements in the light of the current state and future prospects of the science.

It contextualises the industrial plot of "Shirley" on two time levels, on the level of the setting (1811-12) and on the level of the novel\'s production and publication (1848-49).The study first elaborates on "Shirley" as a condition of England novel before shedding light on the historical conditions and their representation in the novel\'s setting. Subsequently, it describes Luddism and Chartism as historical working-class movements, to show that Charlotte Bronte\'s choice of Luddism was partly motivated by fears of political reprisals, by institutional constraints of the publishing sector, as well as by the power of public opinion. Furthermore, this paper deals with the author\'s technique of backdating as a strategy to indirectly comment on Chartism. The examination then turns to the novel\'s representation of the Luddites, and discusses whether the portrayal of the machine wreckers is just a "lurid travesty," as Terry Eagleton contends (cf. Eagleton, 49). It demonstrates that the novel is based on thoroughly researched historical fact', 'id': 'UH_W2ljaj-sC'}, {'categories': ['Literary Criticism'], 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=hIvZOzxPFBYC&dq=19th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'publisher': 'University of Alabama Press', 'title': 'Walt Whitman and Nineteenth-Century Women Reformers', 'description': "Ceniza provides a dramatic rereading of Walt Whitman's poetry through the lens of 19th-century feminist culture. Walt Whitman and 19th-Century Women Reformers documents Whitman's friendships with women during the 1850s, the decade of Whitman's most creative period. The book reveals startling connections between the Þrst three editions of Leaves of Grass and the texts generated by the women he knew during this period, many of whom were radical activists in the women's rights movement. Sherry Ceniza argues that Whitman's editions of Leaves became progressively more radically 'feminist' as he followed the women's rights movement during the 1850s and that he was influenced by what he called the 'true woman of the new aggressive type . . . woman under the new dispensation.' Ceniza documents the progression of the National Woman's Rights movement through the lives and writings of three of its leaders- Abby Hills Price, Paulina Wright Davis, and Ernestine L. Rose. By juxtaposing the texts written by these women with Leaves, Ceniza shows that Whitman used many of the same arguments and rhetorical gestures as his female activist friends. The book also discusses the influence of women engaged in women's rights outside the National Woman's Rights organization. And Ceniza's opening chapter is devoted to a fresh interpretation of the life and thought of another strong-minded woman who influenced the poet's writing-Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, Walt Whitman's mother.", 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9780817357535', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=hIvZOzxPFBYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=hIvZOzxPFBYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '081735753X', 'pageCount': 291, 'authors': ['Sherry Ceniza'], 'id': 'hIvZOzxPFBYC'}, {'categories': ['Political Science'], 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=NXC_AAAAQBAJ&dq=19th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'publisher': 'Routledge', 'subtitle': 'A Comprehensive Introduction', 'title': 'International Human Rights', 'description': 'This book provides a comprehensive introduction to international human rights -- international human rights law, why international human rights have increasingly risen to world prominence, what is being done about violations of human rights, and what might be done to further promote the cause of international human rights so that everyone may one day have their rights respected regardless of who they are or where they live.

Many millions of people lost their lives. Yet while the Rebellion has been intensely studied by scholars in China and elsewhere, we still know little of how individuals coped with these cataclysmic events. Drawing upon a rich array of primary sources, What Remains explores the issues that preoccupied Chinese and Western survivors. Individuals, families, and communities grappled with fundamental questions of loyalty and loss as they struggled to rebuild shattered cities, bury the dead, and make sense of the horrors that they had witnessed.

Divided into four sections, the first, titled "The Many Faces of Sensationalism," provides an eloquent defense of yellow journalism, analyzes the place of sensational pictures, and provides a detailed examination of the changes in reporting over a twenty-year span. The second part, "Mudslinging, Muckraking, Scandals, and Yellow Journalism," focuses on sensationalism and the American presidency as well as why journalistic muckraking came to fruition in the Progressive Era. The third section, "Murder, Mayhem, Stunts, Hoaxes, and Disasters," features a groundbreaking discussion of the place of religion and death in nineteenth-century newspapers.

Moreover, it so happened that Fleck's book, Genesis and Development of a Scientific Fact -the description of a science as it is, not as it should be -was the first epistemological study in which I found echos of my experience in the laboratory. My interest in Fleck was also highlightened by the fact that in his works, and, as I discovered later, in the works of his predecessors of the Polish School of philosophy of medicine, was formulated the problem that had stimulated my interest in the history of medicine and biology, and is still central to my present investigations: the relationships between biological knowledge and clinical practice. The writing of the book was made possible through to the help of many colleagues and friends.

Part of the reason is that there has not until now been a full-scale study of his life and works. This must surely be surprising, when one realizes the length of his academic career (over 50 years) and the extent of his publica tions (over 200) in a wide variety of fields, many of which had immediate and long-term effects on the development of modern mathematics. A study of his life seems long overdue. It appeared to me that the most likely person to write a biography of Peano would be his devoted disciple Ugo Cassina, with whom I studied at the University of Milan in 1957-58. I wrote to Professor Cassina on 29 October, 1963, inquiring if he planned to write the biography, and I offered him my assistance, since I hoped to return to Italy for a year. He replied on 28 November, 1963, suggesting that we collaborate, meaning by this that I would write the biography, in English, using his material and advice. I gladly agreed to this suggestion, but work on the project had hardly begun when Professor Cassina died unexpectedly on 5 October, 1964. I then decided to continue the project on my own.

At the same time, eating performs a kind of vulnerability to the world, revealing a fundamental interdependence between the eater and that which exists outside her body. Racial Indigestion explores the links between food, visual and literary culture in the nineteenth-century United States to reveal how eating produces political subjects by justifying the social discourses that create bodily meaning. Combing through a visually stunning and rare archive of children’s literature, architectural history, domestic manuals, dietetic tracts, novels and advertising, Racial Indigestion tells the story of the consolidation of nationalist mythologies of whiteness via the erotic politics of consumption. Less a history of commodities than a history of eating itself, the book seeks to understand how eating became a political act, linked to appetite, vice, virtue, race and class inequality and, finally, the queer pleasures and pitfalls of a burgeoning commodity culture. In so doing, Racial Indigestion sheds light on contemporary “foodie” culture’s vexed relationship to nativism, nationalism and race privilege.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9780814770054', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=dwaHNbAIDzQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=dwaHNbAIDzQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '0814770053', 'pageCount': 288, 'authors': ['Kyla Wazana Tompkins'], 'id': 'dwaHNbAIDzQC'}, {'categories': ['History'], 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=vRQUCgAAQBAJ&dq=19th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'averageRating': 2.5, 'publisher': 'NYU Press', 'subtitle': 'Eating Bodies in the 19th Century', 'title': 'Racial Indigestion', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9780814770030', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=vRQUCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=vRQUCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '0814770037', 'pageCount': 275, 'authors': ['Kyla Wazana Tompkins'], 'id': 'vRQUCgAAQBAJ'}, {'categories': ['Business & Economics'], 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=Hhf1iGshBKEC&dq=19th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'publisher': 'Routledge', 'subtitle': 'An Anthology', 'title': 'French Liberalism in the 19th Century', 'description': 'Political and economic liberalism has generally been considered to be of marginal import in France, but at an intellectual level, it is a different story.

Kazakhstan is in an enviable position in terms of exportable natural resources, but at the same time it is faced with many domestic problems, such as an inadequate infrastructure. Along with solving a multitude of social problems, Kazakhstan has had to simultaneously create a normal functioning state, which added to its political difficulties. The situation at present is a state run by a strong ruler, which solves some problems but creates others. The Historical Dictionary of Kazakhstan covers the history of Kazakhstan through a chronology, an introductory essay, appendixes, and a bibliography.

In the hands of Johnson and Wilentz, the strange tale of Matthias opens a fascinating window into the turbulent movements of the religious revival known as the Second Great Awakening--movements that swept up great numbers of evangelical Americans and gave rise to new sects like the Mormons. Into this teeming environment walked a down-and-out carpenter named Robert Matthews, who announced himself as Matthias, prophet of the God of the Jews. His hypnotic personality drew in a cast of unforgettable characters--the meekly devout businessman Elijah Pierson, who once tried to raise his late wife from the dead; the young attractive Christian couple, Benjamin Folger and his wife Ann (who seduced the woman-hating Prophet); and the shrewd ex-slave Isabella Van Wagenen, regarded by some as "the most wicked of the wicked." None was more colorful than the Prophet himself, a bearded, thundering tyrant who gathered his followers into an absolutist household, using their money to buy an elaborate, eccentric wardrobe, and reordering their marital relations. By the time the tensions within the kingdom exploded into a clash with the law, Matthias had become a national scandal.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9780199939121', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=c0eTq8CApqMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=c0eTq8CApqMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '0199939128', 'pageCount': 256, 'authors': ['Paul E.

It presents eleven studies ranging from fisheries and invasive species to offshore technology and the study of marine environmental history, bringing together the perspectives of historians and marine scientists to enhance understanding of ocean management of the past, present and future. In doing so, it also highlights the influence that changes in marine ecosystems have upon the politics, welfare and culture of human societies.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9781849772105', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=cGEeEfFegvEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=cGEeEfFegvEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '184977210X', 'pageCount': 250, 'authors': ['Michaela Barnard', 'David J.

These are among the first recordings of black New Orleans jazz bands made in their home city and, as the band consisted of musicians who stayed on in New Orleans after the Great Exodus to Chicago and New York in the early 1920s, the recordings preserve a purer form of the collectively improvised ensemble of the earliest black jazz bands. It is a loosely integrated, purely linear ensemble mass, a collective projecting of melodic lines close to the unassimilated heterophonic singing of the Black Primitive Baptist and Sanctified Churches. This proto jazz style was being rapidly eclipsed in the 1920s by more flamboyant and technically brilliant forms of New Orleans jazz being recorded by Louis Armstrong, Sidney Bechet, and Jelly Roll Morton.

Unlike citizens in the core areas of the Confederacy, many white residents in eastern North Carolina had a strong streak of prewar Unionism and appeared to welcome the Union soldiers when they first arrived. By 1865, however, many of these residents would alter their allegiance, developing a strong sense of southern nationalism. African Americans in the region, on the other hand, utilized the presence of Union soldiers to empower themselves, as they gained their freedom in the face of white hostility.

This textbook will provide readers with a basic historical framework of the period and the critical tools for interpreting and situating new and unfamiliar works of art. Michelle Facos goes beyond existing histories of nineteenth-century art, which often focus solely on France, Britain, and the United States, to incorporate artists and artworks from Scandinavia, Germany, and Eastern Europe. The book expertly balances its coverage of trends and individual artworks: where the salient trends are clear, trend-setting works are highlighted, and the complexity of the period is respected by situating all works in their proper social and historical context. In this way, the student reader achieves a more nuanced understanding of the way in which the story of nineteenth-century art is the story of the ways in which artists and society grappled with the problem of modernity. Key pedagogical features include: Data boxes provide statistics, timelines, charts, and historical information about the period to further situate artworks. Text boxes highlight extracts from original sources, citing the ideas of artists and their contemporaries, including historians, philosophers, critics, and theorists, to place artists and works in the broader context of aesthetic, cultural, intellectual, social, and political conditions in which artists were working. Beautifully illustrated with over 250 color images. Margin notes and glossary definitions. Online resources at www.routledge.com/textbooks/facos with access to a wealth of information, including original documents pertaining to artworks discussed in the textbook, contemporary criticism, timelines and maps to enrich your understanding of the period and allow for further comparison and exploration. Chapters take a thematic approach combined within an overarching chronology and more detailed discussions of individual works are always put in the context of the broader social picture, thus providing students with a sense of art history as a controversial and alive arena of study. Michelle Facos teaches art history at Indiana University, Bloomington. Her research explores the changing relationship between artists and society since the Enlightenment and issues of identity.

Interpreting the Literary Ambiguous', 'description': 'However disconnected the essays in the volume might appear to be at first glance, the unifying factor is the very notion of ambiguity—which is one of the essential features of the postmodern age: how it can be defined as opposed to what it means or is, where it can be found, to what purposes it can be put, including questions of whether it is a positive or negative factor. But this, of course, is not a new phenomenon. Writers have always depended on equivocation, multiplicity of meaning, uncertainty of meaning—deliberate mystification one might say. Language itself is the base of ambiguity not only in literature but in everyday public discourse. Thus the papers in the volume should appeal not only to scholars working in the fields of modern or postmodern literature, but those who see the importance of ambiguity in the earlier texts, and perhaps their influences in later writing. Finally the essays included here not only provide specific analyses and proposed solutions for specific works or authors they also open the reader to other appearances of ambiguity, often not simply in literature or critical theory, but in the kinds of social issues the literary works deals with.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9781443827492', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=JJgnBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=JJgnBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '1443827495', 'pageCount': 255, 'authors': ['Kathleen Dubs'], 'id': 'JJgnBwAAQBAJ'}, {'categories': ['Medical'], 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=O4bPO7Z696QC&dq=19th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'publisher': 'Karger Medical and Scientific Publishers', 'subtitle': 'A Forgotten History of Neurology and Psychiatry', 'title': 'Following Charcot', 'description': "Jean-Martin Charcot, the iconic 19th century French scientist, is still regarded today as the most famous and celebrated neurologist in the world. Despite the development of strong independent schools of thought in the USA, UK and Germany, his 'Salpêtrière' school has become symbolic of the early development and rise of neurological practice and research. This book presents a fresh look at the origins of nervous system medicine, and at the fate of Charcot's school and pupils. Special emphasis is placed upon the parallels and interactions between developments in neurology and mental medicine, clearly demonstrating that Charcot is not only the father of clinical neurology, but also wielded enormous influence upon the field we would come to know as psychiatry. Providing new insights into the life and work of Charcot and his pupils, this book will make fascinating reading for neurologists, psychiatrists, physicians and historians.", 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9783805595568', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=O4bPO7Z696QC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=O4bPO7Z696QC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '3805595565', 'pageCount': 207, 'authors': ['Julien Bogousslavsky'], 'id': 'O4bPO7Z696QC'}, {'categories': ['Law'], 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=Rw8u17SK6r4C&dq=19th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'publisher': 'LexisNexis', 'title': 'Public International Law: Cases, Problems, and Texts (2010)', 'description': 'This book introduces the international legal system in a way that is lively, thought-provoking, and practical.

Yet the experiences of Indigenous peoples in these urban frontiers have been overshadowed by triumphant narratives of progress. This book explores the lives of Indigenous peoples and settlers in two Pacific Rim cities � Victoria, British Columbia, and Melbourne, Australia. Built on Indigenous lands and overtaken by gold rushes, these cities emerged between 1835 and 1871 in significantly different locations, yet both became cross-cultural and segregated sites of empire.

First published in 1968, the AIA Guide to New York City has long been the definitive guide to the city\'s architecture. Moving through all five boroughs, neighborhood by neighborhood, it offers the most complete overview of New York\'s significant places, past and present. The Fifth Edition continues to include places of historical importance--including extensive coverage of the World Trade Center site--while also taking full account of the construction boom of the past 10 years, a boom that has given rise to an unprecedented number of new buildings by such architects as Frank Gehry, Norman Foster, and Renzo Piano. All of the buildings included in the Fourth Edition have been revisited and re-photographed and much of the commentary has been re-written, and coverage of the outer boroughs--particularly Brooklyn--has been expanded. Famed skyscrapers and historic landmarks are detailed, but so, too, are firehouses, parks, churches, parking garages, monuments, and bridges. Boasting more than 3000 new photographs, 100 enhanced maps, and thousands of short and spirited entries, the guide is arranged geographically by borough, with each borough divided into sectors and then into neighborhood. Extensive commentaries describe the character of the divisions. Knowledgeable, playful, and beautifully illustrated, here is the ultimate guided tour of New York\'s architectural treasures.

For all who seek to know of New York, it is here. No home should be without a copy." -- Municipal Art Society "There are two reasons the guide has entered the pantheon of New York books. One is its encyclopedic nature, and the other is its inimitable style--\'smart, vivid, funny and opinionated\' as the architectural historian Christopher Gray once summed it up in pithy W & W fashion." -- Constance Rosenblum, New York Times "A book for architectural gourmands and gastronomic gourmets." -- The Village Voice', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9780199758647', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=MTJlkowOwA4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=MTJlkowOwA4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '0199758646', 'pageCount': 1088, 'authors': ['Norval White', 'Elliot Willensky', 'Fran Leadon'], 'id': 'MTJlkowOwA4C'}, {'categories': ['Juvenile Nonfiction'], 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=NcWcAAAAQBAJ&dq=19th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'publisher': 'Britannica Educational Publishing', 'title': 'English Literature from the 19th Century Through Today', 'description': 'As the British empire expanded ever outward, English writers of the 19th and early 20th centuries such as Charles Dickens, T.S.

Does it tell us what the world is "really" like? What makes it different from other ways of understanding the universe? In Theory and Reality, Peter Godfrey-Smith addresses these questions by taking the reader on a grand tour of one hundred years of debate about science. The result is a completely accessible introduction to the main themes of the philosophy of science. Intended for undergraduates and general readers with no prior background in philosophy, Theory and Reality covers logical positivism; the problems of induction and confirmation; Karl Popper\'s theory of science; Thomas Kuhn and "scientific revolutions"; the views of Imre Lakatos, Larry Laudan, and Paul Feyerabend; and challenges to the field from sociology of science, feminism, and science studies. The book then looks in more detail at some specific problems and theories, including scientific realism, the theory-ladeness of observation, scientific explanation, and Bayesianism. Finally, Godfrey-Smith defends a form of philosophical naturalism as the best way to solve the main problems in the field. Throughout the text he points out connections between philosophical debates and wider discussions about science in recent decades, such as the infamous "science wars." Examples and asides engage the beginning student; a glossary of terms explains key concepts; and suggestions for further reading are included at the end of each chapter. However, this is a textbook that doesn\'t feel like a textbook because it captures the historical drama of changes in how science has been conceived over the last one hundred years. Like no other text in this field, Theory and Reality combines a survey of recent history of the philosophy of science with current key debates in language that any beginning scholar or critical reader can follow.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9780226300610', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=k23egtSWrb8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=k23egtSWrb8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '0226300617', 'pageCount': 288, 'authors': ['Peter Godfrey-Smith'], 'id': 'k23egtSWrb8C'}, {'categories': ['Technology & Engineering'], 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=FBFViPDH0lQC&dq=19th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'publisher': 'JHU Press', 'subtitle': 'Engineering and Industry in Nineteenth-Century America', 'title': 'Waterpower in Lowell', 'description': 'Its clear and instructional discussions of hydraulic technology and engineering principles make it a useful resource for a range of courses, including the history of technology, urban history, and American business history.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9780801897351', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=FBFViPDH0lQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=FBFViPDH0lQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '0801897351', 'pageCount': 272, 'authors': ['Patrick M.

This book explains how, when and where hydrates form, while providing the knowledge necessary to apply remedies in practical applications. New to the second edition, the use of new inhibitors: Kinetic Inhibitors and Anticoagulants and the topic of kinetics of hydrates. How fast do they form? How fast do they melt? New chapters on Hydrates in Nature, hydrates on the seafloor and a new section has also been added regarding the misconceptions about water dew points. Chapters on Hydrate Types and Formers, Computer Methods, Inhibiting Hydrate Formation with Chemicals, Dehydration of Natural Gas and Phase Diagrams Hydrate Dehydration of Natural Gas and Phase Diagrams have been expanded and updated along with the companion website. * Understand what gas hydrates are, how they form and what can be done to combat their formation * Avoid the same problems BP experienced with clogged pipelines * Presents the four most common approaches to evaluate hydrates: heat, depressurization, inhibitor chemicals, and dehydration.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9780080570020', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=TRSXPEPghAwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=TRSXPEPghAwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '008057002X', 'pageCount': 288, 'authors': ['John Carroll'], 'id': 'TRSXPEPghAwC'}, {'categories': ['History'], 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=_5rUFlSnzHQC&dq=19th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'publisher': 'Arcadia Publishing', 'title': 'Irvington', 'description': 'Irvington, a small village 20 miles north of New York City, overlooks the widest point of the Hudson River.

Urbanism is the academic discipline concerned with understanding the spatial organisation and dynamics of urban areas. The quality of the urban environment is a determining factor in the social, economic and environmental performance of societies and the life of citizens. The TU Delft Department of Urbanism seeks to influence the processes of urban change and transformation through explicit design and planning interventions, underpinning practical action to shape the urban environment in a sustainable way. The strong tradition of urbanism in the delta of the Netherlands is a strong factor influencing this major contribution to knowledge and education in the field. Further developments which build on this experience are necessary to address the great challenges of sustainable development, not least with regard to the problems of climate change in delta areas, transformation of brownfield sites and the making of high-quality public space. Of interest to all those committed to building a better urban environment, some of the topics covered in this book include: adaptive environments for human habitats, searching for good urban form, mixed use index (MXI) as a tool for urban planning and analysis and pattern formation in planned urban peripheries.

Did the region fail to settle a longstanding account with its colonial past? Or should we be reluctant to point our finger so far back in time? In a comparative study of asset and income distribution Frankema shows that both the levels, and nature, of income inequality have changed significantly since 1870.

In particular, the authors examine the use of animal models to predict human responses in drug and disease research. The arguments discussed are drawn from both biological and biomedical theory (with numerous examples and case studies drawn from evolutionary biology, complex systems theory, oncology, teratology, and AIDS research), and analyses of empirical evidence (concerning, for example, data on intra- and inter-species differences revealed by recent results from genome analyses of various species, human population studies, and statistical studies of the predictive utility of animal models). This book comes to the unique conclusion that while animals can be successfully used for many endeavors in science such as basic and comparative research, they cannot be used to predict drug and disease response in humans. The arguments presented are rooted in the history, philosophy, and methodology of biomedical research. This book will be of interest to anyone involved, directly or indirectly, in biomedical research (including physicians, veterinarians and scientists), and anyone interested in the history, philosophy and methodology of science. In contrast to books written by and for the animal rights movement and books written by and for the animal-based research industry, this book honestly examines all sides of the scientific arguments for using animals in science and concludes that each group in turn exaggerates the flaws or strengths of using animals. There are areas in science where animals can be viably used but there are also areas where they cannot be so used.

In this work Dr.Donovan contextualizes an important yet relatively neglected author by analyzing an emblematic Irishness that was too often dismissed in the early 19th century as excessive showmanship; the criticism was not without some basis since Owenson was an actor's daughter and grew up in the company of traveling performers. The study includes an extensive discussion of Morgan's personal papers and artifacts housed in the national Library of Ireland and the Royal Irish Academy. No previous study has fully considered this crucial archival material and its implications. In addition unpublished and hitherto unconsulted papers from the Yale University collection are also part of this original research monograph. Owenson's writing is far ranging (she is known both as a polemicist and the author of works on post restoration Italy as well as Ireland) and she commanded the friendship and respect of many early 19th c authors and poets including Byron, Shelley, Moore among many others.

In Sounds of the Metropolis, however, Derek Scott argues that the first popular music revolution actually occurred in the nineteenth century, illustrating how a distinct group of popular styles first began to assert their independence and values. He explains the popular music revolution as driven by social changes and the incorporation of music into a system of capitalist enterprise, which ultimately resulted in a polarization between musical entertainment (or "commercial" music) and "serious" art. He focuses on the key genres and styles that precipitated musical change at that time, and that continued to have an impact upon popular music in the next century. By the end of the nineteenth century, popular music could no longer be viewed as watered down or more easily assimilated art music; it had its own characteristic techniques, forms, and devices. As Scott shows, "popular" refers here, for the first time, not only to the music\'s reception, but also to the presence of these specific features of style. The shift in meaning of "popular" provided critics with tools to condemn music that bore the signs of the popular-which they regarded as fashionable and facile, rather than progressive and serious. A fresh and persuasive consideration of the genesis of popular music on its own terms, Sounds of the Metropolis breaks new ground in the study of music, cultural sociology, and history.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9780199718832', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=mV47XZvVOrAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=mV47XZvVOrAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '0199718830', 'pageCount': 320, 'authors': ['Derek B.

Mainstream solutions still assume a panacea that will cure our climate ills without requiring any serious modification to our way of life. Plan C explores the risks inherent in trying to continue our energy-intensive lifestyle. Using dirtier fossil fuels (Plan A) or switching to renewable energy sources (Plan B) allows people to remain complacent in the face of potential global catastrophe. Dramatic lifestyle change is the only way to begin to create a sustainable, equitable world. The converging crises of Peak Oil, Climate Change and increasing inequity are presented in a clear, concise manner, as are the twin solutions of community (where cooperation replaces competition) and curtailment (deliberately reducing consumption of consumer goods). Plan C shows how each person's individual choices can dramatically reduce CO2 emissions. It offers specific strategies in the areas of food, transportation and housing. One chapter analyzes the decimation of the Cuban economy when the USSR stopped oil exports in 1990 and provides an inspiring vision for a low energy way of living.

Nelson\'s Column in London or the Arc de Triomphe in Paris are obvious examples. In Germany the 19th century witnessed a veritable flood of monuments, many of which rank as national monuments. These reflected and contributed to a developing sense of national identity and the search for national unity; they also document an unsuccessful effort to create a -genuinely German- style.

When he introduced his inaugural series of lectures that summer, on mechanics, Kirchhoff argued that physics should avoid seeking causal explanations and limit itself only to simple and accurate descriptions of natural phenomena. He held to this position, a brand of epistemological phenomenalism, until his retirement nearly ten years later. Kirchhoff's 1875 lectures represent a manifestation of the complicated relationship between philosophy and physics, which characterizes the history of nineteenth-century German science. Using Kirchhoff's story as a wedge, this dissertation examines that relationship. Kirchhoff's philosophical and methdological stance foreshadowed a rising tide of ambivalence about claims to absolute truth in the natural sciences. Looking at episodes from the history of classical physics (electrodynamics, physical chemistry, and thermodynamics) and the history of philosophy of science, this dissertation highlights the complex ways in which physics and philosophy intertwined in the nineteenth century. A close-knit group of professors---including Kirchhoff, Hermann von Helmholtz, Emil du Bois-Reymond, Robert Bunsen, and Eduard Zeller---negotiated the boundaries of their particular disciplines as they debated the purpose and limits of scientific inquiry in general. While philosophical reflections by natural scientists were not uncommon, the methodological and epistemological positions developed by Kirchhoff and his colleagues---at Heidelberg and Berlin---are important because they provided a framework for discussions of the foundations of modern theoretical physics. Occurring in the generation after Kirchhoff's, these foundational discussions paved the way for the modern revolutions in physics and their profound philosophical implications. Kirchhoff's decision to divorce the natural sciences from metaphysical notions, therefore, had significant consequences for science and philosophy in the years around the fin de siecle. The audience for this dissertation will include historians of German physics, historians of nineteenth-century science in general, scholars interested in the intersection between the history of science and philosophy, and those interested in the broader interaction between science and culture.", 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9780549831310', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=gMQrYxMeXMcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=gMQrYxMeXMcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '0549831312', 'pageCount': 402, 'authors': ['Kalil T.

The authors introduce the Prospect Center’s Descriptive Review of Practice, a collaborative inquiry process that provides an opportunity for teachers to examine their practice and gain new perspectives from other participants. The contributors to this volume respond to each child’s modes of thinking as they develop curriculum or find “wiggle room” in curricula they are given. By demonstrating how it is possible to pursue careful knowledge of craft, this book offers ways of teaching that allow for continuing growth and change. Book Features: An inquiry methodology that assists teachers to reflect on the classroom and develop curriculum that responds to children’s interests and needs. Specific examples of a variety of sources teachers can draw on and think about to improve practice. A method of data collection that can inform practice while allowing for the unevenness, messiness, and essential humanness of teaching and learning. “Making Space for Active Learning is a collection that stands alone and gets to the heart of what we mean by learning and teaching. Each contribution reminded me of how much I miss being in the classroom and how much we're missing in current so-called school reform discourse. Keep this book handy. A chapter at a time will restore some needed sanity about what's important.” —Deborah Meier, author and education activist “This book is a moving and powerful collection of teachers' work that holds the possibility of inspiring and changing new teachers' practice.” —Kathy Schultz, Dean and Professor, School of Education, Mills College “This book will add significantly to the expanding and important literature about The Prospect Processes which were developed over many years at the Prospect School and Center in Vermont.

Why We Teach Now offers us the voices of teachers like 42-year veteran Mary Ginley, who wonders, “Why would anyone with any brains and imagination ever want to be a teacher?” Who then answers her own question affirmatively, “It’s because somehow, even today, even with all the insanity, all the rules, all the poorly designed textbooks, all the directives to teach to the test, there are kids out there who need good teachers.” At a time when politicians, policymakers, and philanthropists are quick to denigrate teachers’ work and arrogantly speak for the profession,Why We Teach Now offers teachers the room and respect to speak for themselves. Once again, Nietogives teachers and those who care about education the inspiration and energy to embrace their role as advocates—a role that is vital not only for the well-being of students but also for the future of the profession and our nation. Praise for Why We Teach: “These pieces reveal the passion and hope that keep people in the classroom. Inspiration and information, Why We Teach raises our understanding of the dedication that fuels people's commitment to this profession.” —Rethinking Schools “This collection of essays written by teachers from across the country demonstrates exactly why there is hope for our public schools. Their words reveal why--in spite of bureaucracy and low pay—they continue to teach. This book should be required reading for college students planning to enter the profession. Teachers already in the classroom, whether for five years or twenty-five, will be encouraged and inspired.” —VOYA", 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9780807773611', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=dAV6BgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=dAV6BgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '0807773611', 'pageCount': 289, 'authors': ['Sonia Nieto'], 'id': 'dAV6BgAAQBAJ'}, {'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'authors': ['James A.

The goal is to teach young children to critically interpret the daily messages they receive in popular entertainment that increasingly blur toys, stories, and advertising. The first half of this practical resource features case studies that show how six early childhood teachers working together in teacher study groups developed and implemented play-based literacy learning and media production.

While adults will recognize the naughty antics as a ploy for attention, children will dissolve into giggles as the dragon devours every last sandwich, blows bubbles in the lemonade, and leaves claw prints in the brownies.

And is handy to carry with you at all times as you will want to pick it up as often as you can!! I spent hours sat reading story after story and then snuck stories in between doing jobs!! I just love Tom\'s unique writing style and the Preface at the beginning of the book is almost like a story in itself. Tom has an incredible imagination and the way he conveys it to paper is just truely captivating. I could spend hours waffling on about each story but I feel that I would spoil too much for you - the reader. And I can\'t pick a favourite story either as it too close to call, Fear of Needles however had me gripped and I had to read it all in one go!! The stories in this book really get your mind going and no matter what your age make you want to ensure your feet are tucked inside your duvet and think about what it is that goes bump in the night!!! I must say that I\'m very upset at not being one of those lucky co-workers that received emails baring the words \'Hello All\'" ************************************************ Review by Kipp Poe Speicher on April 2, 2010: A unique Voice that needs to be heard! This book is an amazing read filled with stories that will have you fearing the unknown and the dark once more.

It summarizes the research on the value of high-quality services for young children, families, and society, showing why early education matters both today and into the future. Emphasizing the need to understand and respect young children’s strengths and unique characteristics, the authors offer inspiration for working in the field, as well as addressing the realistic challenges of implementing developmentally appropriate care and education. Each chapter begins with an introductory vignette focused on one child whose experiences are typical of other children in the same age group or life circumstances, using that child’s experiences to draw out what the best research tells us about why early care and education matters for that group of children. The book also features first-person narratives by early childhood professionals working in a range of positions who offer insight into the complexity and joys of working with or on behalf of young children. Suggestions for further reading and concluding questions for reflection, dialogue, and action make The Early Years Matter a perfect resource for courses and professional development. “Hyson and Tomlinson do not simply provide a straightforward and comprehensive view of early childhood education; they humanize it through the experiences of children, families, and early childhood professionals. They leave the reader with a clear understanding of the myriad of ways in which high-quality early childhood education programs matter in the early years, and they matter a lot.” —From the Foreword by Jacqueline Jones “This book does a remarkable job of inviting future and current practitioners further into the world of the early childhood profession. It provides clear, interesting, and succinct overviews of issues critical for those working in early childhood to understand, weaving in the most recent developments in research, policy, and practice in accessible ways. Each section of the book also literally puts a face on a selected issue, inviting readers to meet a child and family experiencing the issue, as well as colleagues focusing on it in their work.

Why We Teach Now offers us the voices of teachers like 42-year veteran Mary Ginley, who wonders, "Why would anyone with any brains and imagination ever want to be a teacher?"

This is the first book written specifically for school counselors about using creative and expressive arts counseling techniques in school settings. It presents over 100 interventions using art, drama, music, writing, dance, and movement that school counselors can easily incorporate into their practices with individual students and groups, and in classroom settings. These creative interventions, based on the American School Counselor Association (ASCA) National Model framework, support the key student domains of academic, career, and personal/social development. The text also meets the important demand for accountability in school counseling by providing guidelines for evaluating the effectiveness of each intervention. Addressing such issues as emotional expression, social skills development, managing anger/aggression, developing self-esteem, working well with diverse peers, career exploration, and academic skill development, the book is organized by specific types of expressive arts therapies and how they can be used to support different domains in the ASCA model. Each intervention outlines the presenting concerns for which it is most useful, appropriate grade levels, required materials, preparation needed, step-by-step instructions, modifications for special needs students, and an outcome assessment plan. A handy quick reference chart helps readers to quickly locate appropriate interventions for specific concerns. Ideal for the school counselor, social worker, or psychologist who may not have specific training in arts therapies, this book can also help trained arts therapists who will be working in a school setting to select appropriate interventions.

She had no idea how right she would be. In Beyond Myself, she narrates the love story that developed between her and her anthropology professor, Dr. Ben Dennis, an African tribal chief. In this memoir, she shares how God sustained her during her interracial, cross-cultural marriage—especially as she played the role of chief’s wife in a remote village in Liberia, West Africa. Her life was full of extremes. She met the president of Liberia in the Executive Mansion—and slept in a mud hut. She visited European capitals—and lived in a remote African village. She flew on transatlantic flights—and was carried through the high forest in a chief’s hammock. Anita shares her struggles as she is accepted into the Mende tribe and lived in Vahun with an off and on kerosene fridge, swarming termites on the screens, a cyclone barely missing the house, and pungent elephant meat delivered in the middle of the night. Beyond Myself offers an example of West meets Africa personified. Anita tells how life with Ben was more than a marriage. It was an education and adventure wrapped into one. Ben allowed Anita to escape her narrow cultural confines and embark on a journey from farm girl to global citizen, with plenty of missteps throughout.

Haumersen has led a different and exciting life. In The Life Story of a Solider, he narrates his story with all of its interesting twists and turns during his eighty-plus years. From his birth in Racine, Wisconsin, through his schooling at West Point, to his service in the military, his life abroad, and his retirement years, Haumersen tells of a life well lived. The anecdotes cover surviving many near-death experiences from the time he was four years old and lasting through much of his military career, including drowning, narrowly escaping a mortar round by eighteen inches, being missed by snipers by less than a foot, and avoiding machine-gun fire from his own ack-ack platoon. In this memoir, Haumersen offers insight into an array of circumstances, including combat in the Korean War as well as meeting his wife, Elise, and raising a family. The Life Story of a Solider recalls a successful life that was based on always doing what was right.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9781491748398', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=sKzKBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=sKzKBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '1491748397', 'pageCount': 268, 'authors': ['John P.

After a lot of chit chat back and forth reminiscing about old family stories and happenings, Charles (or Chuck as we know him) brought out his tape recorder. Quizzically, he posed this simple question, "What can you tell me about Papa?" He was referring to our father, Ernest Hubert Madere. With feelings of unified dismay, none of the five of us were able to provide Chuck with any new information about Papa other than what he already knew. Consequently, in order for the children of Carolyn and me, namely Joni, Colin, and Lana, to have some inkling regarding where I lived, what I did, and get a glimpse into my psyche before they were born and then grew up knowing me, this tome will provide some insight. Our children will have historical and genealogical information concerning their ancestry in words, pictures, and other relative and associated odds and ends. Nowadays, family members tend to get scattered hither and yon. Children often get permanently displaced regarding their backgrounds and family records. Items like birth certificates, report cards, names of first and second cousins, aunts, uncles, close friends, associates, and similar pertinent items gets lost in the shuffle as time steadily marches on. Hopefully, this ponderous volume will soothe many misgivings our children may have about who they are, the backgrounds of their ancestors, and precisely where they came from.

SS cavalrymen underwent a continuous brutalisation which saw them commit acts of mass violence with thousands of victims, a development only comparable to that of the Einsatzgruppen and battalions of the order police. Going beyond a unit history, Henning Pieper analyses the role and behavior of the brigade's personnel and places it within the context of research on perpetrators and the operational history of the Waffen-SS.

This volume will serve as an excellent aid to the selection of optimal therapeutic strategies based on preoperative diagnosis. A further important feature is the emphasis placed on radiologic, clinical, and surgical correlations. Pancreatic cystic neoplasms (PCNs) have been increasingly recognized during the past decade, mainly because of the widespread use of modern imaging modalities for the investigation of often unrelated abdominal symptoms. The three most common subtypes of PCN are serous cystic neoplasms, mucinous cystic neoplasms, and intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms. These subtypes have distinct radiologic and histopathological features, and their biological behavior differs greatly. Accurate preoperative diagnosis is of prime importance in selecting the optimal therapeutic strategy: while serous cystic neoplasms are almost always benign, and may be treated conservatively, mucinous cystic neoplasms and intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms have malignant potential, warranting an aggressive surgical approach, i.e., pancreatectomy. Pancreatic Cystic Neoplasms will be of great interest to surgeons, gastroenterologists, radiologists, oncologists, and pathologists, and also to internists and residents in these specialties.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9788847057081', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=KZNxBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=KZNxBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '8847057086', 'pageCount': 74, 'authors': ['George H.

When Nic, a slave in the mines outside of Rome, is forced to enter a sealed cavern containing the lost treasures of Julius Caesar, he finds much more than gold and gemstones: He discovers an ancient bulla, an amulet that belonged to the great Caesar and is filled with a magic once reserved for the Gods -- magic some Romans would kill for. Now, with the deadly power of the bulla pulsing through his veins, Nic is determined to become free. But instead, he finds himself at the center of a ruthless conspiracy to overthrow the emperor and spark the Praetor War, a battle to destroy Rome from within. Traitors and spies lurk at every turn, each more desperate than the next to use Nic's newfound powers for their own dark purposes. In a quest to stop the rebellion, save Rome, and secure his own freedom, Nic must harness the magic within himself and defeat the empire's most powerful and savage leaders.", 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9780545837347', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=eKYQBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=eKYQBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '0545837340', 'pageCount': 5, 'authors': ['Jennifer A.

Instead of sending his players into a losing battle against emotion, indecision, and fear on the golf course, he shows them how to organize their thoughts and use them for maximum performance. His step-by-step Pre-Shot Pyramid provides any player with the ideal blueprint for shot setup.

It makes no difference if you are 8 or 68, people want that moment in time where everything went right, the stars were aligned and only you could see and feel it happening. This story is about that happening to a 15 year boy who dreamed every day about being the best baseball player that ever lived. He, with the help of friends, three especially, had that dream come true. He accomplished more in one year than most people do in a lifetime and baseball was a large part. His accomplishments were well beyond his 15 year old beliefs, and they established the ground work for an incredible future. How can a kid have so much fun while developing lifelong relationships, developing the ground work for being a successful dad, a good coach, a successful business person and an all around happiness in life. So if you like hook slides, homeruns, stories about being winners, a life time of positive attitudes, well buckle up and start reading. This book is about smiling, loving and as I have already said, being a winner. I have always said that if, I learn one thing every day and make someone smile, then that day was a success. Every person who reads this book will smile and hopefully learn a small thing or two.

They must destroy the shades infesting the Manse and the warlock controlling them. With the task half done, Arthur and Morgan begin to realize that what they\'ve been told isn\'t the whole story.

Countless societies throughout history have used it to form a vast array of foods and drinks, many of which were integral and essential to those cultures; it could be argued that the production of beer and bread formed the basis of many agriculture-based civilizations. Today, nearly every person on the planet consumes fermented products, from beer and wine, to bread and dairy products, to certain types of meat and fish. Fermentation is a nearly ubiquitous process in today's food science, and an aspect of chemistry truly worth understanding more fully. In The Oxford Handbook of Food Fermentations, Charles W. Bamforth and Robert E. Ward have collected and edited contributions from many of the world's experts on food fermentation, each focused on a different fermentation product. The volume contains authoritative accounts on fermented beverages, distilled beverages, and a diverse set of foods, as well as chapters on relevant biotechnology. Each chapter embraces the nature of the product, its production, and its final composition. The text also touches on the raw materials and processes involved in producing packaged foodstuff, and the likely future trends in each area. In the conclusion, Bamforth and Ward present a comparison between the various products and the diverse technologies employed to produce them. Fermentation is a multifaceted process that affects a wide variety of products we consume, and The Oxford Handbook of Food Fermentations is the definitive resource that captures the science behind fermentation, as well as its diverse applications.", 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9780199742707', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=oKDNAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=oKDNAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '0199742707', 'pageCount': 805, 'authors': ['Charles W.

His quest started after he received a questionnaire form an Air Force Fighter Squadron, which led him to his father’s stack of military orders, other papers, and pictures. Major James A. Downey Jr. had never disclosed the details about his service during World War II, and the research turned into an eye-opening experience for his son. Major Downey was in the Philippines and China in the 1930s, areas that his son would get to know well decades later on his trips to Vietnam. The elder Downey also spent time in Germany and was one of the few sent back to the Philippines for the planed X-Day invasion of Japan.
