Banned in Tibet, forgotten in China, the Tibetan tradition of Zen was almost completely lost to us. According to Tibetan histories, Zen teachers were invited to Tibet from China in the 8th century, at the height of the Tibetan Empire. When doctrinal disagreements developed between Indian and Chinese Buddhists at the Tibetan court, the Tibetan emperor called for a formal debate. When the debate resulted in a decisive win by the Indian side, the Zen teachers were sent back to China, and Zen was gradually forgotten in Tibet. This picture changed at the beginning of the 20th century with the discovery in Dunhuang (in Chinese Central Asia) of a sealed cave full of manuscripts in various languages dating from the first millennium CE. The Tibetan manuscripts, dating from the 9th and 10th centuries, are the earliest surviving examples of Tibetan Buddhism. Among them are around 40 manuscripts containing original Tibetan Zen teachings. This book translates the key texts of Tibetan Zen preserved in Dunhuang. The book is divided into ten sections, each containing a translation of a Zen text illuminating a different aspect of the tradition, with brief introductions discussing the roles of ritual, debate, lineage, and meditation in the early Zen tradition. Van Schaik not only presents the texts but also explains how they were embedded in actual practices by those who used them.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'id': '1Tu-rQEACAAJ', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1Tu-rQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1Tu-rQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '1559394463', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=1Tu-rQEACAAJ&dq=10th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'authors': ['Sam Van Schaik'], 'ISBN_13': '9781559394468'}, {'categories': ['Religion'], 'pageCount': 240, 'publisher': 'UNC Press Books', 'title': 'Who Is Allah?', 'description': "This vivid introduction to the heart of Islam offers a unique approach to understanding Allah, the central focus of Muslim religious expression. Drawing on history, culture, theology, politics, and the media, Bruce B. Lawrence identifies key religious practices by which Allah is revered and remembered, illuminating how the very name of Allah is interwoven into the everyday experience of millions of Muslims. For Muslims, as for adherents of other religions, intentions as well as practices are paramount in one's religious life. Lawrence elucidates how public utterances, together with private pursuits, reflect the emotive, sensory, and intellectual aspirations of the devout. Ranging from the practice of the tongue (speaking) to practices in cyberspace (online religious activities), Lawrence explores how Allah is invoked, defined, remembered, and also debated. While the practice of the heart demonstrates how Allah is remembered in Sufism, the mystical branch of Islam, the practice of the mind examines how theologians and philosophers have defined Allah in numerous contexts, often with conflicting aims. The practice of the ear marks the contemporary period, in which Lawrence locates and then assesses competing calls for jihad, or religious struggle, within the cacophony of an immensely diverse umma, the worldwide Muslim community.", 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'id': 'zkWhBwAAQBAJ', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=zkWhBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=zkWhBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '1469620049', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=zkWhBwAAQBAJ&dq=10th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'authors': ['Bruce B.

In Africa, a continent where up to 3,000 languages are spoken, ethnicity can be especially difficult to define. Unfortunately, perceived ethnic differences have all too often produced tragic results. This book analyzes the role of ethnicity in contemporary African politics and governance. It examines the corrosive legacy of the slave trade and European colonization, details some of the bloody conflicts that have erupted from ethnic frictions, and describes how divisions that appear to be ethnically based often have more to do with class and religion.

Also revealed in MATS is the use of the Aleph Tav as it is incorporated into the creation of hundreds of Hebrew words used thousands of times throughout the Tanakh and how the "mark" incorporates Y\'shua haMashiach (Jesus the messiah), as well as all mankind and creation, which substantiates and expresses its divinity, thus taking our understanding of the scriptures to a whole new level.

Excerpt: The Chalukya dynasty (Kannada: ) was an Indian royal dynasty that ruled large parts of southern and central India between the 6th and the 12th centuries. During this period, they ruled as three related yet individual dynasties. The earliest dynasty, known as the "Badami Chalukyas," ruled from Vatapi (modern Badami) from the middle of the 6th century. The Badami Chalukyas began to assert their independence at the decline of the Kadamba kingdom of Banavasi and rapidly rose to prominence during the reign of Pulakesi II. After the death of Pulakesi II, the Eastern Chalukyas became an independent kingdom in the eastern Deccan. They ruled from Vengi until about the 11th century. In the western Deccan, the rise of the Rashtrakutas in the middle of the 8th century eclipsed the Chalukyas of Badami before being revived by their descendants, the Western Chalukyas, in the late 10th century. These Western Chalukyas ruled from Kalyani (modern Basavakalyan) until the end of the 12th century. The rule of the Chalukyas marks an important milestone in the history of South India and a golden age in the history of Karnataka. The political atmosphere in South India shifted from smaller kingdoms to large empires with the ascendancy of Badami Chalukyas. A Southern India based kingdom took control and consolidated the entire region between the Kaveri and the Narmada rivers. The rise of this empire saw the birth of efficient administration, overseas trade and commerce and the development of new style of...', 'ISBN_13': '9781230771526'}, {'categories': ['Juvenile Nonfiction'], 'pageCount': 224, 'publisher': 'Chicago Review Press', 'subtitle': 'More Than 50 Activities', 'title': "A Kid's Guide to Arab American History", 'description': 'Many Americans, educators included, mistakenly believe all Arabs share the same culture, language, and religion, and have only recently begun immigrating to the United States.

Another purpose is to develop some general understandings about sub stance uses and their effects which are less clouded by the mass hysteria and political considerations which often obscure drug issues in our own society. Examination of drug-use patterns in a country where millions of people are users on a regular basis, and where there has been familiarity with the drug for several hundred years, offers an opportunity to achieve perspectives not possible in countries with different attitudes and without such histories. I am not sanguine about the prospects of our abilities to learn from others or from the past, but I do not think we should abandon hope of doing so.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'id': 'rxYrBgAAQBAJ', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=rxYrBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=rxYrBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '9401568766', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=rxYrBgAAQBAJ&dq=10th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'authors': ['J.G.

The life of Copernicus, extending from 19 February 1473 to his death on 24 May 1543, was not too rich in adventures or biographical facts. Born in Toruti from a family of Polish burghers, he received his first university training in Cracow between 1491-1494. From Cracow he proceeded to Italy to spend the years between 1496-1503 at the Universities of Bologna, Padua and Ferrara - with occasional visits to Rom- in preparation for an ecclesiastical career. When Bishop Watzenrode - his patron and maternal uncle - could no longer extend his leave, Copernicus returned to Poland in 1503 to enter the service of the church establishment, which soon led to a canonry at the Frombork (Frauenburg) Cathedral in Warmia. And there - in the northern mists not far from the Baltic shores - in a land so different in climate from the sunny Italy of his youth - he was destined to spend the rest of his life.", 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'id': 'NX4JBgAAQBAJ', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NX4JBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NX4JBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '9401026165', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=NX4JBgAAQBAJ&dq=10th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'authors': ['B.

At the same meeting European scientists spoke on the dendrochronological dating of lakeshore settlements and the effects of larch bud moth attack on trees in the Alps. It is possible that American participants were not in a position to fully appreciate these papers either. In other words, dendrochronology is an extremely interdisciplinary science; its facets range from modern statistics on wood anatomy to the history of art. It is difficult even for dendrochronol ogists to keep in touch with the whole spectrum, and even more difficult for the layman to obtain an overall view of the many methods and fields of application. In recent times specialisation has begun to hinder communication be tween the various sectors. Archaeologists, for instance, set up their own dendrochronological laboratories and construct independent chronologies to serve their particular interests. The scientific institutions which previously carried out such work are now turning more and more to strongly statistically or biologically-oriented questions. The full wealth of information contained in tree rings, however, will be revealed only when dendrochronologists make a concerted effort to relate the findings of the different fields.

It attempts to reconcile the concept of social evolution with that of the structural unity of Man, an idea that is becoming increasingly dominant in the exact as well as in the social sciences. The idea of structure as it emerges from the social field is applied to the human mind as the ultimate cause of society. While pragmatism interpreted the mind as reacting as a whole, the concept of structure places the relation of Man versus his Environment in a different light, and attempts to determine the possible limits of social development. These problems are analyzed in a number of introductory chapters while the basic approach is illustrated by an analysis of some aspects of the growth of Western civilization.

The medical, legal, and counseling needs of the rape victim are presented to prepare helping professionals to offer sensitive and skillful assistance to women who have suffered sexual assault. The interdisciplinary thrust of the book reflects our conviction that health professionals, police, and prosecuting attorneys must share their expertise and coordinate their efforts in order to successfully meet the multiple needs of rape victims and their families. While an exten sive literature on rape has developed in the past decade, to the best of our knowledge there is no single source for the practical treatment-oriented information sought by those who work directly with victims. The primary objective of this book is to offer just such a guide to service providers. The book is organized into sections that deal with a specific area of the treatment of victims. Detailed guidelines are provided for the nursing, med ical, counseling, police, and legal services involved in comprehensive crisis intervention. Interdisciplinary teaming and the emotional impact of rape on service providers are discussed by authors actively involved in rape crisis work. Rape laws are explained and court preparation for victim-witnesses is carefully outlined. Of particular relevance to counselors is an overview of crisis theory and a psychodynamic perspective on rape trauma.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'id': '3zULBgAAQBAJ', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=3zULBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=3zULBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '1468436899', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=3zULBgAAQBAJ&dq=10th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'authors': ['S.L.

Nearly all have been prepared by citizens of the country (and, for that matter, even each subregion) considered. In the case of exceptions (e.g. Suriname), the authors have conducted fieldwork on the coast of the country they treat.

Nearly every coastal country in Europe is represented whereas for Africa and South America there are major gaps. In addition, there are 2 instances of overlap. In the case of England (with a shoreline of nearly 3,000 km) a complementary chapter on Lincolnshire (with a shoreline of only 155 km) is included.

Critically surveying prior scholarship, Wedemeyer exposes the fallacies of attributing Tantric transgression to either the passions of lusty monks, primitive tribal rites, or slavish imitation of Saiva traditions. Through comparative analysis of modern historical narrativesÑthat depict Tantrism as a degenerate form of Buddhism, a primal religious undercurrent, or medieval ritualismÑhe likewise demonstrates these to be stock patterns in the European historical imagination. Through close analysis of primary sources, Wedemeyer reveals the lived world of Tantric Buddhism as largely continuous with the Indian religious mainstream and deploys contemporary methods of semiotic and structural analysis to make sense of its seemingly repellent and immoral injunctions. Innovative, semiological readings of the influential Guhyasamaja Tantra underscore the textÕs overriding concern with purity, pollution, and transcendent insightÑissues shared by all Indic religionsÑand a large-scale, quantitative study of Tantric literature shows its radical antinomianism to be a highly managed ritual observance restricted to a sacerdotal elite. These insights into Tantric scripture and ritual clarify the continuities between South Asian Tantrism and broader currents in Indian religion, illustrating how thoroughly these ÒradicalÓ communities were integrated into the intellectual, institutional, and social structures of South Asian Buddhism.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'id': 'urzm9J4tbpwC', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=urzm9J4tbpwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=urzm9J4tbpwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '0231530951', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=urzm9J4tbpwC&dq=10th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'authors': ['Christian Wedemeyer'], 'ISBN_13': '9780231530958'}, {'categories': ['Religion'], 'pageCount': 704, 'publisher': 'Princeton University Press', 'title': 'The Princeton Encyclopedia of Islamic Political Thought', 'description': "The first encyclopedia of Islamic political thought from the birth of Islam to today, this comprehensive, authoritative, and accessible reference provides the context needed for understanding contemporary politics in the Islamic world and beyond.

These themes include: the different social implications of self vs. other representation and the permeability of the personal/social and the public/private; how scriptural practices ("inscription") serve as sites for social discipline; the historical and intertextual frameworks for the meaning potentials of orthographic choice (relating to issues of genre and style); and writing as a broader semiotic field: the visual and esthetic dimensions of texts and metalinguistic "play" in spelling and its ambiguous implications for writer stance. -- Publisher description.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'id': 'BJo5AgAAQBAJ', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=BJo5AgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=BJo5AgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '1614511365', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=BJo5AgAAQBAJ&dq=10th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'authors': ['Alexandra Jaffe'], 'ISBN_13': '9781614511366'}, {'categories': ['Antiques & Collectibles'], 'pageCount': 1560, 'averageRating': 4.0, 'publisher': 'Krause Publications', 'title': 'Standard Catalog of World Coins 1601-1700', 'description': "A worldwide network of experts continues to uncover collector coin issues never before published.

This study tracks the evolution of the Halveti order from its modest origins in medieval Azerbaijan to the emergence of its influential Sa'baniyye branch, whose range extended throughout the Empire at the height of its expansion. By carefully reconstructing the lives of formerly obscure figures in the history of the order, a complex picture emerges of the connections of Halveti groups with the Ottoman state and society. Even more importantly, since the Sa'baniyye branch of the order grew out of the towns and villages of the northern Anatolian mountains rather than the major urban centres, this work has the added benefit of bringing a unique perspective to how Ottoman subjects lived, worked, and worshiped outside the major urban centres of the Empire. Along the way, it sheds light on less-visible actors in society, such as women and artisans, and challenges widely-held generalizations about the activities and strategies of Ottoman mystics.", 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'id': 'pb5vAAAAQBAJ', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=pb5vAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=pb5vAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '0748686916', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=pb5vAAAAQBAJ&dq=10th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'authors': ['John Curry'], 'ISBN_13': '9780748686919'}, {'categories': ['Travel'], 'pageCount': 256, 'publisher': 'Monaco', 'subtitle': 'Highlights of a Fascinating City', 'title': 'The Prague Book', 'description': "Breathtaking images, some in fold-out format, capture the essence of the city.

Environmentalists have tended to disparage shifting cultivation (sometimes called 'swidden cultivation' or 'slash-and-burn agriculture') as unsustainable due to its supposed role in deforestation and land degradation. However, a growing body of evidence indicates that such indigenous practices, as they have evolved over time, can be highly adaptive to land and ecology. In contrast, 'scientific' agricultural solutions imposed from outside can be far more damaging to the environment. Moreover, these external solutions often fail to recognize the extent to which an agricultural system supports a way of life along with a society's food needs. They do not recognize the degree to which the sustainability of a culture is intimately associated with the sustainability and continuity of its agricultural system. Unprecedented in ambition and scope, Voices from the Forest focuses on successful agricultural strategies of upland farmers. More than 100 scholars from 19 countries--including agricultural economists, ecologists, and anthropologists--collaborated in the analysis of different fallow management typologies, working in conjunction with hundreds of indigenous farmers of different cultures and a broad range of climates, crops, and soil conditions. By sharing this knowledge--and combining it with new scientific and technical advances--the authors hope to make indigenous practices and experience more widely accessible and better understood, not only by researchers and development practitioners, but by other communities of farmers around the world.", 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'id': 'Q8xgM8Hf_L8C', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Q8xgM8Hf_L8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Q8xgM8Hf_L8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '1136522271', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=Q8xgM8Hf_L8C&dq=10th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'authors': ['Malcolm Cairns'], 'ISBN_13': '9781136522277'}, {'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=4jxCbwAACAAJ&dq=10th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'ISBN_13': '9781158197545', 'ISBN_10': '1158197543', 'pageCount': 532, 'publisher': 'Books LLC', 'authors': ['Books Llc'], 'title': 'Medieval Treaty Texts: 10th-Century Treaties, 11th-Century Treaties, 12th-Century Treaties, 13th-Century Treaties, 14th-Century Treaties', 'description': 'Please note that the content of this book primarily consists of articles available from Wikipedia or other free sources online.

He mentions his association with many scholars in the lands through which he travelled. However, most of what we know of him comes from the internal evidence of his own works.

Dramatic full-color photographs and in-depth profiles of Earth’s major lakes highlight the beauty and complexity of these regions.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'id': 'fdKcAAAAQBAJ', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=fdKcAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=fdKcAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '1615304037', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=fdKcAAAAQBAJ&dq=10th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'authors': ['Britannica Educational Publishing'], 'ISBN_13': '9781615304035'}, {'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'authors': ['LLC Books'], 'pageCount': 774, 'id': '0SGqSgAACAAJ', 'ISBN_10': '1158163576', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=0SGqSgAACAAJ&dq=10th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'publisher': 'Books LLC', 'subtitle': '10th-Century Treaties, 11th-Century Treaties, 12th-Century Treaties, 13th-Century Bc Treaties, 13th-Century Treaties', 'title': 'Treaties by Century', 'description': 'Please note that the content of this book primarily consists of articles available from Wikipedia or other free sources online.

Also many concepts familiar to readers in Ireland are not familiar to readers in other countries. Therefore I have supposed that many readers will be coming to the subject for the first time. I trust that those who are already familiar with the subject will not regard me as condescending. Everyone has to start at some point. It should be remembered that records were kept and history written about the activities of the chiefs and noblemen. Little was written about ordinary people who formed the vast bulk of the population. We have to find what we can about them indirectly, for example from records of harvests kept on big estates. All of western civilization is derived from what happened in the various lands and regions in Western Europe after the decline and fall of the Western Roman Empire. Numerous warrior families poured across the old frontiers of the Empire and adapted themselves to the Roman way of life. Usually they adopted the Latin language, though in England they did not. As the political and military power of Rome declined another power developed, that of the Christian Church based on Rome. It kept literacy and the art of writing alive. The various post-Roman states were ruled by kings who depended on the Christian clergy for much of their administration, and indeed for their defence. This however led to prolonged disputes as to the limits of the authority of the religious and secular powers. These states were then subjected to prolonged attacks by pagan peoples like the Vikings and Huns from the north the south and the east. They gradually reorganised themselves to beat off the invaders. Central to this organisation was the castle and the mounted knight. The whole structure of society was re-formed on the basis of supporting these. At the same time there were attempts to get the clergy to lead lives different from those of knights and more in keeping with their religious vocation. The invaders were driven off. Those to the north and east accepted Christianity and developed their states on the latest western European lines. Only in the south, in Spain and Africa did the threat remain. England, a former province of the Roman Empire was taken over by various Germanic-speaking families called Angles and Saxons and they at an early date, accepted Christianity. England suffered very heavily from the raiders from the north, the Vikings, but early in the 10th century succeeded in forming a unified kingdom and controlling the Vikings. In the 11th century the Anglo-Saxon rulers were overthrown by Normans from Normandy who introduced the feudal system of government which had grown up on the Continent. Ireland, though never a part of the Roman Empire, had accepted Christian missionaries in the 5th century and became a Christian country. It too suffered from the Viking invasions, and succeeded largely in overcoming them. Many of the Vikings remained in Ireland and brought many innovations to Ireland. As an island beyond an island Ireland was usually the last to keep up with developments. The Irish clergy began to try to adapt themselves to the standards of the new reform in Church affairs on the Continent. There was a fresh irruption into Irish affairs when some of the Norman king of England’s subjects were invited to take part in a struggle between Irish chiefs and were promised grants of land in Ireland. This would effectively have removed them from the authority of their feudal overlord, so he too went to Ireland to assert his authority over them. He received a general assent from the Norman knights, the Gaelic chiefs and the Irish bishops that he would be their feudal overlord and then departed. That might have been the end of the matter. For various reasons it became necessary to send more knights to Ireland to maintain the peace and to assert the king’s authority. The knights for their part began to deve', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'id': 'ngc0osGk8FsC', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ngc0osGk8FsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ngc0osGk8FsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '1453584315', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=ngc0osGk8FsC&dq=10th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'authors': ['Desmond Keenan'], 'ISBN_13': '9781453584316'}, {'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=vRWhcQAACAAJ&dq=10th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'ISBN_13': '9781156090435', 'ISBN_10': '1156090431', 'pageCount': 322, 'publisher': 'Books LLC', 'authors': ['LLC Books'], 'title': 'Church Buildings Established in the 10th Century: Burials in the Rila Monastery, Christian Monasteries Established in the 10th Century', 'description': "Chapters: Burials in the Rila Monastery, Christian Monasteries Established in the 10th Century, Oriental Orthodox Congregations Established in the 10th Century, Rila Monastery, Westminster Abbey, Boris Iii of Bulgaria, Sherborne Abbey, Romsey Abbey, Cluny Abbey, Mezhyhirya Monastery, Mainz Cathedral, Akhtala Monastery, Akdamar Island, Pannonhalma Archabbey, Esphigmenou Monastery, Fenari Isa Mosque, Pistoia Cathedral, Hosios Loukas, Haghpat Monastery, Zograf Monastery, Prato Cathedral, John of Rila, Hrelja, Church of the Virigin Mary, Great Lavra, All Saints' Church, Earls Barton, Oshki, Dr beck Abbey, Vatopedi Monastery, Sacra Di San Michele, St. Stephen's Church, Mainz, Petershausen Abbey, Selz Abbey, San Pietro, Perugia, San Bartolomeo All'isola, Seeon Abbey, Abbey of Santo Domingo de Silos, Cathedral of Ani, Memleben Abbey, San Giorgio Monastery, Sanahin Monastery, All Saints Church, Bakewell, Kadamattom Church, San Saba, Rome, Cathedral of Kars, San Paolo a Ripa D'arno, Khakhuli Monastery, Tavistock Abbey, James David Bourchier, Badia Fiorentina, Horomos, Makravank Monastery, Narekavank, Burtscheid Abbey, Saint Mercurius Church in Coptic Cairo, Church of St. Dunstan, Mayfield, San Pietro a Grado, Marmashen Monastery, P hlde Abbey, Helmarshausen Abbey, Church of San Salvador de Priesca, St Neots Priory, Vahanavank, Bedia Cathedral, Iviron Monastery, Santa Maria in Via, Chertsey Abbey, New Minster, Winchester, Pitsunda Cathedral, Baume Abbey, San Sebastiano Al Palatino, Gr ningen Priory, St. Stephen's Abbey, Augsburg, Mokva Cathedral, Dochiariou Monastery, Cheropotamou Monastery, B evnov Monastery, Cerne Abbey, Cholsey Abbey, Sveti Naum, Shoana Church, Fischbeck Abbey, Senty Church, Philotheou Monastery, Gladbach Abbey, Pazhuvil Church, Monastery of Saint George, Skyros.

However, it does not aim to give a comprehensive presentation of these topics, but rather to highlight some geographical, political and cultural aspects of the theme. Since Norway was not the only Scandinavian kingdom to develop state-like structures and strive for control over territories overseas it has been natural to consider Denmark's Baltic 'empire' and the making of a greater Sweden too, in order to provide a framework for the case of Norway.", 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'id': 'EIr7s7SLit0C', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=EIr7s7SLit0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=EIr7s7SLit0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '8251925630', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=EIr7s7SLit0C&dq=10th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'authors': ['Steinar Imsen'], 'ISBN_13': '9788251925631'}, {'categories': ['Religion'], 'pageCount': 681, 'publisher': 'John Hunt Publishing', 'subtitle': '100 Holy People Who Have Shaped the History of Humanity', 'title': 'Beacons of the Light', 'description': "Beacons of Light is a priceless and inspiring gift from the good and open heart of one of the global interfaith movement's wisest and most respected leaders, Marcus Braybrooke.

Our image of Islam in the Soviet Union has changed a lot in the last three decades. During the Cold War period, Western observers were mainly driven by the question whether Islam - and above all the Sufi brotherhoods with their male disciples - could become a political and military threat to Moscow's rule in Central Asia and the Caucasus. Russian scholars, by contrast, regarded Sufi sm as a threat because the Sufi shrines attracted a mainly female audience; these women would transmit the 'superstitions' of Islam to their children and contribute to the dominance of Muslim traditionalism - a kind of Soviet subculture that seemed to be resistant against atheist education. As shown in the lecture, Western and Soviet researchers made the same methodological mistakes; and today we often repeat these mistakes when stereotyping Islamic 'fundamentalism'.

Praise for MEDIEVAL IVORY CARVINGS: "A summation of a lifetime’s involvement with the study of medieval ivories and a triumph of scholarship - one of the defining publications in the field.” The Art Newspaper "The end result is the nearest thing to perfection attained in any catalogue of ivories today.” West 86th: A Journal of Decorative Arts, Design History, and Material Culture (Bard Graduate Center) "The volume is, in sum, not simply a catalogue of ivories but a fundamental contribution to the history of medieval art.” The Burlington Magazine "A superlative achievement, setting a high standard for all future catalogues and making an immense contribution to scholarship.” Speculum: Journal of Medieval Studies', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'id': 'cEB6RAAACAAJ', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=cEB6RAAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=cEB6RAAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '1851776125', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=cEB6RAAACAAJ&dq=10th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'authors': ['Paul Williamson'], 'ISBN_13': '9781851776122'}, {'categories': ['Art'], 'pageCount': 239, 'averageRating': 4.0, 'publisher': 'World Wisdom, Inc', 'subtitle': 'Language and Meaning', 'title': 'Art of Islam', 'description': 'Islam.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'id': 'DBqId4J_sIAC', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=DBqId4J_sIAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=DBqId4J_sIAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '1933316659', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=DBqId4J_sIAC&dq=10th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'authors': ['Titus Burckhardt'], 'ISBN_13': '9781933316659'}, {'categories': ['Bali (Indonesia : Province)'], 'pageCount': 298, 'publisher': 'Universitätsverlag Göttingen', 'subtitle': 'Ethnoarchaeological Investigations in North Bali, Indonsia', 'title': 'Burials, Texts and Rituals', 'description': "The villages on Bali's north-east coast have a long history. Archaeological findings have shown that the coastal settlements of Tejakula District enjoyed trading relations with India as long as 2000 years ago or more. Royal decrees dating from the 10th to the 12th century, inscribed on copper tablets and preserved in the local villages as part of their religious heritage, bear witness to the fact that, over a period of over 1000 years, these played a major role as harbour and trading centres in the transmaritime trade between India and (probably) the Spice Islands. At the same time the inscriptions attest to the complexity in those days of Balinese society, with a hierarchical social organisation headed by a king who resided in the interior - precisely where, nobody knows. The interior was connected to the prosperous coastal settlements through a network of trade and ritual. The questions that faced the German-Balinese research team were first: Was there anything left over of this evidently glorious past? And second: Would our professional anthropological and archaeological research work be able to throw any more light on the vibrant past of these villages? This book is an attempt to answer both these and further questions on Bali's coastal settlements, their history and culture.", 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'id': 'K7AcwO4jxFIC', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=K7AcwO4jxFIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=K7AcwO4jxFIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '3940344125', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=K7AcwO4jxFIC&dq=10th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'authors': ['Brigitta Hauser-Schäublin', 'I Wayan Ardika'], 'ISBN_13': '9783940344120'}, {'categories': ['Juvenile Nonfiction'], 'pageCount': 16, 'publisher': 'Courier Corporation', 'title': 'Samurai Stained Glass Coloring Book', 'description': 'Japanese samurai are celebrated in this treasury of 16 powerful illustrations.

It still represents the world's largest database to compare the responsories of the Office of the Dead in more than 2,000 sources. Since the order of these responsories differed from church to church, this order can be used to localize medieval and Renaissance liturgical books. The book is therefore an absolute necessity for everyone who conducts research on the area it covers.

Not only are most of them of unknown origin, but also lack a precise date. Tracing their sources is difficult because of the scant information provided by art dealers in previous periods. Thus, only preliminary investigations into their stylistic development and technical features have been made so far. Moreover, until recently none of the Chinese temples that provided their original context, i.e. their precise position within those temple compounds and their respective place in the Buddhist pantheon, have been examined at all.In her study, Petra H. Rösch investigates these very aspects, including questions about the religious position and function of the sculptures of this special Bodhisattva. She also looks at the technical construction, the collecting of Chinese Buddhist sculptures in general and those made of wood in particular.She uses a combination of stylistic, iconographical, buddhological, as well as technical methodologies in her investigation of the Water-moon Guanyin images and sheds light on the Buddhist temples in Shanxi Province, the works of art they once housed, and the religious practices of the eleventh to thirteenth centuries connected with them.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'id': 'NmEZBQAAQBAJ', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NmEZBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NmEZBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '3898216624', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=NmEZBQAAQBAJ&dq=10th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'authors': ['Petra R\x9asch'], 'ISBN_13': '9783898216623'}, {'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'pageCount': 150, 'id': 'qmUDpiimFA0C', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=qmUDpiimFA0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=qmUDpiimFA0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '1435732723', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=qmUDpiimFA0C&dq=10th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'publisher': 'Lulu.com', 'authors': ['Jean Elizabeth Ward'], 'title': 'Wang Wei: Remembered', 'description': 'Jean Elizabeth Ward proudly presents this book with the poetry of Wang Wei, Famous Chinese Tang Poet, included are the poems inspired by and written by Jean Elizabeth Ward,an American Poet Laureate.

This book takes a flexible and inclusive approach to these trends, revealing both how Sufis approached theological traditions and themes and practised theology themselves, and how theologians approached different aspects of Sufism. Comprising chapters by leading specialists in the field, this volume is the first to explore the historically complex interface between these two major currents, highlighting key points of tension and interaction. Taking us through an array of subjects, including hermeneutics, psychology and metaphysics, light is shed on major intellectual trends and figures from the 12th century up to the modern period.
