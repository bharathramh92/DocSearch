This long-overdue reappraisal examines Frankl\'s life and intellectual evolution anew, from his early immersion in Freudian and Adlerian theory to his development of the "third Viennese school" amid the National Socialist domination of professional psychotherapy. It teases out the fascinating contradictions and ambiguities surrounding his years in Nazi Europe, including the experimental medical procedures he oversaw in occupied Austria and a stopover at the Auschwitz concentration camp far briefer than has commonly been assumed. Throughout, author Timothy Pytell gives a penetrating but fair-minded account of a man whose paradoxical embodiment of asceticism, celebrity, tradition, and self-reinvention drew together the complex strands of twentieth-century intellectual life.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9781782388319', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=3ClRCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=3ClRCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '1782388311', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=3ClRCgAAQBAJ&dq=20th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'authors': ['Timothy Pytell'], 'id': '3ClRCgAAQBAJ'}, {'categories': ['Transportation'], 'pageCount': 320, 'averageRating': 4.0, 'publisher': 'Icon Books', 'subtitle': 'The Trainspotter as 20th-Century Hero', 'title': 'Platform Souls', 'description': 'Nicholas Whittaker’s much-loved classic recollects the long sunny days of his childhood when, notepad in hand, jam sandwiches in the duffel bag, he happily spent his time jotting down train numbers during the Indian summer of steam and the heyday of diesel. Whittaker returns to his roots in this updated edition, casting a sceptical eye over recent developments, catching up with old acquaintances and considering the toll that half a century of ridicule and a couple of decades of privatisation have wrought upon his beloved pastime. As Andrew Martin notes in his Foreword, this is ‘one of the best books ever written about rail enthusiasm’. Equally it is a poetically written memoir of growing up in a more innocent age, a hymn to British eccentricity and to the virtues of observing the world around you: ‘Spotters – of trains, planes, buses or birds – are a last redoubt for something rapidly vanishing from our lives: looking outward, seeing, observing. People notice things less and less these days, while watching things more and more.’ Praise for the first edition: ‘An elegy: for the steam trains already vanishing when Whittaker’s hobby began in 1964; for the short-lived diesel age which followed; for an era of near innocence.’ Times Literary Supplement ‘Whittaker writes with humour and considerable evocative power ...

This penetrating commentary presents the concept of death as a unifying motif that illuminates many of the difficulties and obscurities of Heidegger\'s philosophy. Heidegger comes to see death as revealing the ultimate meaning not only of human existence, but of being itself. He thus confers upon the concept a force and sharpness, an ontological depth which is found in perhaps no other philosopher. This study corroborates the much-debated "turning" in Heidegger\'s philosophy. Demslce finds death to be the key not only to Heidegger\'s treatment of man and being, but also the key to his shift of focus from man to being. All Heidegger\'s various approaches to the theme of death are considered -- his existential-phenomenological analysis of Dasein, his discussions of art, poetry, history, and language, and his new phenomenological approach to the ordinary things of life. The author approaches Heidegger on his own terms, allowing the philosopher to speak for himself. The present reading of Heidegger grows smoothly out of Heidegger\'s own intentions. The result is a revealing study of Heidegger\'s philosophy in its entirety, which answers some persistently perplexing questions about this difficult modern philosopher.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9780813162881', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=tNseBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=tNseBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '0813162882', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=tNseBgAAQBAJ&dq=20th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'authors': ['Mark Friedberger'], 'id': 'tNseBgAAQBAJ'}, {'categories': ['Medical'], 'pageCount': 224, 'publisher': 'Xlibris Corporation', 'title': 'The Remarkable Developments of Heart and Chest Surgery in the 20th Century', 'description': 'The author is a board-certified thoracic and heart surgeon who studied and learned the craft of thoracic surgery under one of the great pioneers in the development of heart surgery.

Using alliance politics as the main framework of analysis, it offers a new interpretation that contrasts with the traditional views that war is an interruption of the American foreign policy emphasis on diplomacy. Instead, it posits that war has been the norm during the past century while peaceful interludes were but a time of respite and preparation for the next conflict. After a thorough discussion of the concepts of alliance building and the containment doctrine, the work then addresses such themes as the alliance networks used to confront German and Japanese powers during the early 20th century wars, the role of alliances in containing the Soviet Union during the Cold War, the creation of alliances to restrict and defeat rogue state powers, and whether they were useful when dealing with the challenges posed by terrorism in the post-9/11 world.

It analyses the interaction between body and language in her first five books of poetry. Drawing on the Italian feminist thought of il pensiero della differenza sessuale, it examines the ways in which Marçal’s poetic images display her Catalan feminine subjectivity, including the function of the poet, the space of poetry and the representation of love. It also explores the potentiality of the space of poetry to reconstruct female identity and reconfigure reality. In addition, it unravels the way in which the poet uses poetry to express the love for the other whilst also extending the boundaries of the self. The central concern is to bridge the fissure between female experience and universal precepts on the art of poetry through the predominance of an embodied and natural iconography. This study presents Marçal’s poetic compositions within the international panorama of poetry and feminist studies and aims to open up new terrains of discussion in the field of language, body and writing.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9781781880005', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=zRogAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=zRogAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '178188000X', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=zRogAwAAQBAJ&dq=20th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'authors': ['Noèlia Díaz Vicedo'], 'id': 'zRogAwAAQBAJ'}, {'categories': ['BIOGRAPHY & AUTOBIOGRAPHY'], 'pageCount': 1406, 'publisher': 'Routledge', 'subtitle': 'Dictionary of World Biography', 'title': 'The 20th Century Go-N', 'description': "Each volume of the Dictionary of World Biography contains 250 entries on the lives of the individuals who shaped their times and left their mark on world history.

The first book follows the histories of some common types of building: houses, hospitals, schools, offices and prisons. Examples are drawn from the 19th and early 20th centuries in France, America and Britain, with the central focus on London. They include the 'pavilion hospitals' associated with the name of Florence Nightingale, English Board and Modernist schools of the 1920s and 30s, tall office buildings in Chicago and New York, Jeremy Bentham's Panopticon penitentiary, and 'radial prisons' on the model of Cherry Hill and Pentonville. The second book takes these histories and uses them to explore how the forms of these buildings are constrained by some of the basic functions of architecture: to provide daylight and ventilation to the interior, to provide access to all rooms, or to allow occupants to see from one part of a building to another. A new way of thinking about these 'worlds of geometrical possibility' is introduced, in which the forms of many buildings can be catalogued and laid out systematically in 'morphospaces', or theoretical spaces of forms. As building types change over time, they come to occupy different positions within the worlds of possible forms. Building Types and Built Forms is filled with over 400 illustrations, many drawn especially for the book. It offers a new theoretical approach, combined with a series of historical accounts of building types, some well known, some less familiar. It should appeal to academics, practitioners, historians and students of architecture.", 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9781783062591', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NioNAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NioNAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '1783062592', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=NioNAwAAQBAJ&dq=20th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'authors': ['Philip Steadman'], 'id': 'NioNAwAAQBAJ'}, {'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=gBo5AwAAQBAJ&dq=20th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'ISBN_13': '9781480780644', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=gBo5AwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=gBo5AwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '1480780642', 'pageCount': 35, 'publisher': 'Teacher Created Materials', 'authors': ['Timothy Rasinski', 'Lorraine Griffith'], 'title': "20th Century Reader's Theater Scripts", 'description': "As students regularly read and perform reader's theater scripts about America, they improve decoding, interpretation, fluency, and comprehension.

The topics covered range from scientific discoveries of all kinds, advances in treatment, and conceptual breakthroughs. The highlights are countered by the field's negative sides: perennial indecisiveness about the boundaries of psychiatry; the limitations of a narrow approach to human suffering; the retreat from the hope of a de-institutionalised, community-based psychiatry; the divide between biological treatments and psychotherapy; the technical and ethical complexities of psychiatric research; and the low priority given to psychiatry, especially but far from exclusively in less developed countries. The result is a text full of collected wisdom which will promote the curiosity of mental health professionals about key developments in psychiatry over the past half century; sensitize the next generation of mental health professionals to the role they might play in advancing the state of knowledge about mental illness and its treatment during the course of their careers; and serve as a valuable archival resource for scholars. This collection of viewpoints from very experienced leaders in the field of psychiatry will prove fascinating reading for psychiatrists and allied mental health professionals, such as psychologists, psychiatric social workers, psychiatric nurses and occupational therapists, both trained and in training. It will also offer the interested laity a balanced account of psychiatry's evolution since the 1950s, and its likely prospects in the 21st century.Readership: Psychiatrists and allied mental health professionals, such as psychologists, psychiatric social workers, psychiatric nurses, and occupational therapists, trained and in training; the lay public who are commonly puzzled about what contemporary psychiatry has accomplished and what it may offer in the future.", 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9780199638963', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=pDVjAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=pDVjAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '0199638969', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=pDVjAwAAQBAJ&dq=20th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'authors': ['Sidney Bloch', 'Stephen A.

You will be directed towards additional reading, which will develop or confirm the subject knowledge you will need to achieve QTS. the curriculum guide is up-to-date, revised to take account of Curriculum 2000 and accepted 'good practice' in primary science teaching and learning. It is also flexible - many of the Units are stand-alone. They can be undertaken in any order, at your own pace, to complement school experiences. The Units are practical and feasible: the activities suggested can be undertaken by the non-specialist; in many cases without specialized equipment or access to large numbers of pupils. The guide is comprehensive, covering all the primary science elements in Curriculum 2000 and giving background information into other aspects of primary science teaching. It is also supportive - the guide suggests further texts to support trainees' own understanding of the scientific and pedagogical concepts involved. Additional reading draws on the TTA's list of approved key texts. The original text was piloted by students following a distance-learning PGCE course. It has been revised and updated in line with their comments and to meet Curriculum 2000 and Curriculum Guidance for the Foundation Stage. The text was initially developed as a core text for the part-time distance-learning course at Liverpool Hope and is designed for trainee teachers on distance learning and flexible routes, returning, converting or overseas teachers.", 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9781134207787', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=tW9TAQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=tW9TAQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '1134207786', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=tW9TAQAAQBAJ&dq=20th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'authors': ['Paul Harremoes', 'David Gee', 'Malcom MacGarvin', 'Andy Stirling', 'Jane Keys', 'Brian Wynne', 'Sofia Guedes Vaz'], 'id': 'tW9TAQAAQBAJ'}, {'categories': ['Business & Economics'], 'pageCount': 288, 'publisher': 'Routledge', 'subtitle': 'Late Lessons from Early Warnings', 'title': 'The Precautionary Principle in the 20th Century', 'description': 'The precautionary principle is widely seen as fundamental to successful policies for sustainability.

By the year 2000, however, Greenville had become an economically diverse city of more than 60,000. The explosion in the bright leaf tobacco industry, the establishment of a public university, the recruitment of new manufacturing interests, and the creation of a regional medical complex contributed to this growth.

It’s no coincidence that geniuses not only dare to dream of the impossible for their work, but do the same for their lives. They’re audacious enough to think that they’re not just ordinary players. Few stories better illustrate this better than the life of the father of the modern world, a man of legendary imaginative power and wonder: Nikola Tesla. In this book, you’ll be taken on a whirlwind journey through Tesla’s life and work, and not only learn about the successes and mistakes of one of history’s greatest inventors, but also how to look at the world in a different, more imaginative way.

This lavish book represents the modern movement in Cuban architecture, from art nouveau and art deco to the flowering of high modernism just before the Revolution, spanning from the early 1900s to 1965. At a time when travelers are rediscovering Cuba, this volume offers a range of the city’s twentieth-century cultural achievements. The photographs, shot exclusively for the book, show examples from the artsy Vedado neighborhood, the seaside streets of Miramar, Central Havana, and Havana’s posh Country Club Park area. Included are iconic places such as Cuba’s remarkably futuristic National Schools of Art; the art deco landmark Bacardi building; Casa de Alfred von Schulthess by Richard Neutra; the stylish Habana Riviera Hotel, and its original 1957 interiors; the Hotel Nacional de Cuba designed by McKim, Mead & White, on Havana’s seaside drive the Malecón; and the world-famous Tropicana cabaret nightclub by architect Max Borges.

They envelop all human beings from birth to death. As such, they provide the context for human existence. At the same time, however, time and space also serve as major influencing factors in mankind's actions. Hence, a vast literature has developed on time and space as separate dimensions, and recently on time-space as joint dimensions. Interestingly enough, the social connotations of time and space have mostly been studied with the individual human being in mind. The more societal significance of time and space, whether separately or jointly, have been relatively neglected. It is the purpose of this volume to help fill this lacuna through discussions on some of the many junctions of time, space, and society at large. The discussion will naturally involve concepts and findings from more than just one discipline -- notably, geography, sociology, social history and political science.

As Earth warms, sea levels are rising mainly because ocean water expands as it warms; and water from melting glaciers and ice sheets is flowing into the ocean. Sea-level rise poses enormous risks to the valuable infrastructure, development, and wetlands that line much of the 1,600 mile shoreline of California, Oregon, and Washington. As those states seek to incorporate projections of sea-level rise into coastal planning, they asked the National Research Council to make independent projections of sea-level rise along their coasts for the years 2030, 2050, and 2100, taking into account regional factors that affect sea level. Sea-Level Rise for the Coasts of California, Oregon, and Washington: Past, Present, and Future explains that sea level along the U.S. west coast is affected by a number of factors. These include: climate patterns such as the El Niño, effects from the melting of modern and ancient ice sheets, and geologic processes, such as plate tectonics. Regional projections for California, Oregon, and Washington show a sharp distinction at Cape Mendocino in northern California. South of that point, sea-level rise is expected to be very close to global projections. However, projections are lower north of Cape Mendocino because the land is being pushed upward as the ocean plate moves under the continental plate along the Cascadia Subduction Zone. However, an earthquake magnitude 8 or larger, which occurs in the region every few hundred to 1,000 years, would cause the land to drop and sea level to suddenly rise.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9780309255950', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=wWF0AAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=wWF0AAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '0309255953', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=wWF0AAAAQBAJ&dq=20th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'authors': ['Committee on Sea Level Rise in California, Oregon, and Washington', 'Board on Earth Sciences and Resources', 'Ocean Studies Board', 'Division on Earth and Life Studies', 'National Research Council'], 'id': 'wWF0AAAAQBAJ'}, {'categories': ['Business & Economics'], 'pageCount': 192, 'publisher': 'Routledge', 'subtitle': 'Past Problems and Future Scenarios', 'title': 'Drought', 'description': 'First Published in 2011.

The introduction by archives specialist Mary Savig explores the intersections between commercial holiday cards and the art world--how holiday cards were first marketed as "affordable art" and how selling their art to card companies often provided income for artists in lean times. She then opens up the more intimate dimensions of an artist\'s social network, illuminating their relationships with dealers, curators, teachers, and close friends. Captions introduce each artist, compare or contrast the holiday card to his/her body of work, and discuss the relationship to the recipient when relevant. Handmade Holiday Cards illustrates and contextualizes a broad range of one-of-a-kind artworks or limited edition print series by well-known artists such as Josef Albers, Milton Avery, Alexander Calder, Robert Indiana, John Lennon and Yoko Ono, Robert Motherwell, Nickolas Muray, and Ad Reinhardt.

This global democratic revolution is probably the most important political trend in the late twentieth century. In The Third Wave, Samuel P. Huntington analyzes the causes and nature of these democratic transitions, evaluates the prospects for stability of the new democracies, and explores the possibility of more countries becoming democratic. The recent transitions, he argues, are the third major wave of democratization in the modem world. Each of the two previous waves was followed by a reverse wave in which some countries shifted back to authoritarian government. Using concrete examples, empirical evidence, and insightful analysis, Huntington provides neither a theory nor a history of the third wave, but an explanation of why and how it occurred. Factors responsible for the democratic trend include the legitimacy dilemmas of authoritarian regimes; economic and social development; the changed role of the Catholic Church; the impact of the United States, the European Community, and the Soviet Union; and the "snowballing" phenomenon: change in one country stimulating change in others. Five key elite groups within and outside the nondemocratic regime played roles in shaping the various ways democratization occurred. Compromise was key to all democratizations, and elections and nonviolent tactics also were central. New democracies must deal with the "torturer problem" and the "praetorian problem" and attempt to develop democratic values and processes. Disillusionment with democracy, Huntington argues, is necessary to consolidating democracy. He concludes the book with an analysis of the political, economic, and cultural factors that will decide whether or not the third wave continues. Several "Guidelines for Democratizers" offer specific, practical suggestions for initiating and carrying out reform. Huntington\'s emphasis on practical application makes this book a valuable tool for anyone engaged in the democratization process. At this volatile time in history, Huntington\'s assessment of the processes of democratization is indispensable to understanding the future of democracy in the world.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9780806186047', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=IMjyTFG04JYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=IMjyTFG04JYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '0806186046', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=IMjyTFG04JYC&dq=20th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'authors': ['Samuel P.

Ian Atack identifies the contribution of nonviolence to political theory through connecting central characteristics of nonviolent action to fundamental debates about the role of power and violence in politics. This in turn provides a platform for going beyond historical and strategic accounts of nonviolence to a deeper understanding of its transformative potential.From Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King to toppled communist regimes in Eastern Europe and pro-democracy movements in Serbia, Georgia and Ukraine, nonviolent action has played a significant role in achieving social and political change in the last century. The Arab Spring revolutions, particularly those in Tunisia and Egypt, and the Occupy movement in the US and UK demonstrate that nonviolence continues to be a vital feature of many campaigns for democracy, human rights and social justice.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9780748649679', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=FYtvAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=FYtvAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '0748649670', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=FYtvAAAAQBAJ&dq=20th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'authors': ['Iain Atack'], 'id': 'FYtvAAAAQBAJ'}, {'categories': ['History'], 'pageCount': 400, 'averageRating': 4.0, 'publisher': 'Nation Books', 'subtitle': 'A Social Justice Hall of Fame', 'title': 'The 100 Greatest Americans of the 20th Century', 'description': 'The 100 Greatest Americans of the 20th Century, offers a colorful and witty history of the most influential progressive leaders of the twentieth century and beyond, is the perfect antidote.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9781568586946', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=AC9c8DbURckC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=AC9c8DbURckC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '1568586949', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=AC9c8DbURckC&dq=20th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'authors': ['Peter Dreier'], 'id': 'AC9c8DbURckC'}, {'categories': ['Science'], 'pageCount': 199, 'publisher': 'Jones & Bartlett Publishers', 'title': '20th Century Microbe Hunters', 'description': 'Inspire your students with the stories behind the achievements of ten 20th century microbiologists.

Judith Butler plots the French reception of Hegel and the successive challenges waged against his metaphysics and view of the subject, all while revealing ambiguities within his position. The result is a sophisticated reconsideration of the post-Hegelian tradition that has predominated in modern French thought. Butler’s study remains a provocative and timely intervention in contemporary debates on the unconscious, the powers of subjection, and the subject. This edition features a foreword by French philosophical scholar Philippe Sabot, which accompanied the French edition of Subjects of Desire and was widely praised for its keen understanding of Butler’s insight and legacy.

The twentieth century comes to life as an age of ideas--a time when, for good and for ill, the thoughts of the few reigned over the lives of the many. Judt presents the triumphs and the failures of prominent intellectuals, adeptly explaining both their ideas and the risks of their political commitments. Spanning an era with unprecedented clarity and insight, Thinking the Twentieth Century is a tour-de-force, a classic engagement of modern thought by one of the century’s most incisive thinkers. The exceptional nature of this work is evident in its very structure--a series of intimate conversations between Judt and his friend and fellow historian Timothy Snyder, grounded in the texts of the time and focused by the intensity of their vision. Judt\'s astounding eloquence and range are here on display as never before. Traversing the complexities of modern life with ease, he and Snyder revive both thoughts and thinkers, guiding us through the debates that made our world. As forgotten ideas are revisited and fashionable trends scrutinized, the shape of a century emerges. Judt and Snyder draw us deep into their analysis, making us feel that we too are part of the conversation. We become aware of the obligations of the present to the past, and the force of historical perspective and moral considerations in the critique and reform of society, then and now. In restoring and indeed exemplifying the best of intellectual life in the twentieth century, Thinking the Twentieth Century opens pathways to a moral life for the twenty-first. This is a book about the past, but it is also an argument for the kind of future we should strive for: Thinking the Twentieth Century is about the life of the mind--and the mindful life.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9781101559871', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=59yPqcGsDhUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=59yPqcGsDhUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '110155987X', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=59yPqcGsDhUC&dq=20th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'authors': ['Tony Judt'], 'id': '59yPqcGsDhUC'}, {'categories': ['Music'], 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=5Ws61_Fp1koC&dq=20th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'ISBN_13': '9781619112438', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=5Ws61_Fp1koC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=5Ws61_Fp1koC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '1619112434', 'publisher': 'Mel Bay Publications', 'authors': ['Norman M.

First, in the 1930s and 1940s, famine, war and political upheaval caused massive population losses. Previous evaluations of overall losses have given an idea of the scale of these catastrophes but do not distinguish between crisis mortality, birth shortfall and loss through emigration. Based on a painstaking work of reconstitution, this study is the first to provide a detailed estimation of the hecatomb in terms of number of deaths and life expectancy. The famine of 1933 was alone responsible for the deaths of 2.6 million Ukrainians and reduced male and female life expectancies to 7 and 11 years respectively. Once the crises of the 1930s and 1940s were over, the earlier trend in health resumed and mortality declined steadily until the 1960s. At this point, however, a new type of crisis appeared that caused a sustained reversal in the existing trends. Life expectancy for women stopped increasing altogether, while that for men began a relentless year on year regression. Notwithstanding the confusing picture created by the fluctuations of the 1980s and 1990s, the long-term trend is to further deterioration. To understand the factors involved, this study analyses in detail the combined effects of different causes of death at different ages.\u200b', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9789400724334', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=UCprz5gQIhsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=UCprz5gQIhsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '9400724330', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=UCprz5gQIhsC&dq=20th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'authors': ['France Meslé', 'Jacques Vallin'], 'id': 'UCprz5gQIhsC'}, {'categories': ['History, Modern'], 'pageCount': 320, 'publisher': 'Dorling Kindersley Ltd', 'title': '20th Century', 'description': 'Presents the key political, historical and cultural events that shaped the twentieth century.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9781409383918', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=eekF9iBHE4YC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=eekF9iBHE4YC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '1409383911', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=eekF9iBHE4YC&dq=20th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'authors': ['R.

But a number of 20th century artists have turned this notion on its head by attempting to create artworks based on randomness. Among those, three in particular articulated a well-argued and thorough theory of the radical use of chance in art: André Breton (writer), John Cage (composer) and François Morellet (visual artist). The implications of such a move away from established aesthetics are far-reaching, as much in conceptual as in practical terms, as this book hopes to make clear. Of paramount importance in this coincidentia oppositorum is the suggested possibility of a correlation between the artistic use of chance and a system of thought itself organised around chance. Indeed placing randomness at the centre of one’s art may have deeper philosophical consequences than just on the aesthetical level.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9789401207263', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=6Nu3H8FelHQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=6Nu3H8FelHQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '9401207267', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=6Nu3H8FelHQC&dq=20th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'authors': ['Denis Lejeune'], 'id': '6Nu3H8FelHQC'}, {'categories': ['American poetry'], 'pageCount': 60, 'averageRating': 4.0, 'publisher': 'Lulu.com', 'title': '20th Century PowWow Playland', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9781105786105', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=YezhAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=YezhAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '1105786102', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=YezhAwAAQBAJ&dq=20th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'authors': ['Mihku Paul'], 'id': 'YezhAwAAQBAJ'}, {'categories': ['History'], 'pageCount': 127, 'publisher': 'Arcadia Publishing', 'title': 'Highland Park in the 20th Century', 'description': "Throughout the 1900s, Highland Park maintained a sophisticated, small-town atmosphere with a spirit of welcome despite its transient population.

During that conflict Germany with its unrestricted submarine warfare campaign of 1917 nearly drove Great Britain to the negotiating table. Its U-boats sank 6,196 ships of 13,438,632 gross register tons. Despite post-war attempts to ban the submarine from warfare, it survived. Both Italy and Germany used submarines, covertly, during the Spanish Civil War (1936 - 1939). This book, Part Two of a series, discusses the use of submarines during World War Two (1939 - 1945) and their effectiveness. It focuses principally on two strategic submarine campaigns. The first is about German U-boats against British and neutral commerce. That campaign finally failed during the Battle of The Atlantic in 1943. The second deals with American submarines against Japanese shipping from Southeast Asia to the home islands, a campaign that successfully isolated Japan from its sources of raw materials and foodstuffs during 1944 and effectively defeated Japan.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9781462042616', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=nyYSERH9wrgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=nyYSERH9wrgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '1462042619', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=nyYSERH9wrgC&dq=20th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'authors': ["Captain John F.

Joanna Grossman and Lawrence Friedman show how vast, oceanic changes in society have reshaped and reconstituted the American family. Women and children have gained rights and powers, and novel forms of family life have emerged. The family has more or less dissolved into a collection of independent individuals with their own wants, desires, and goals. Modern family law, as always, reflects the brute social and cultural facts of family life. The story of family law in the twentieth century is complex. This was the century that said goodbye to common-law marriage and breach-of-promise lawsuits. This was the century, too, of the sexual revolution and women's liberation, of gay rights and cohabitation. Marriage lost its powerful monopoly over legitimate sexual behavior. Couples who lived together without marriage now had certain rights. Gay marriage became legal in a handful of jurisdictions. By the end of the century, no state still prohibited same-sex behavior. Children in many states could legally have two mothers or two fathers. No-fault divorce became cheap and easy. And illegitimacy lost most of its social and legal stigma. These changes were not smooth or linear--all met with resistance and provoked a certain amount of backlash. Families took many forms, some of them new and different, and though buffeted by the winds of change, the family persisted as a central institution in society. Inside the Castle tells the story of that institution, exploring the ways in which law tried to penetrate and control this most mysterious realm of personal life.", 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9781400839773', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=VBMoKsX6RU4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=VBMoKsX6RU4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '1400839777', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=VBMoKsX6RU4C&dq=20th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'authors': ['Joanna L.

The techniques developed in the field allow many real-life applications with great societal value. For instance, urban monitoring, fire detection, or flood prediction can have a great impact on economical and environmental issues. To attain such objectives, the remote sensing community has turned into a multidisciplinary field of science that embraces physics, signal theory, computer science, electronics, and communications. From a machine learning and signal/image processing point of view, all the applications are tackled under specific formalisms, such as classification and clustering, regression and function approximation, data coding, restoration and enhancement, source unmixing, model inversion, data fusion or feature selection and extraction.

Since World War I a number of bureaucratic manifestations of IM have been tried in wartime. With the exception of the U.S. Info.

This focus is not exclusive to the work of left-wing poets: the problem of capitalismâe(tm)s effect on individuals, communities, and cultures is central to a wide variety of poetry, across a range of political and aesthetic orientations. Indeed, Nealon asserts, capitalism is the material out of which poetry in English has been created over the last century. Much as poets of previous ages continually examined topics such as the deeds of King Arthur or the history of Troy, poets as diverse as Jack Spicer, John Ashbery, and Claudia Rankine have taken as their âeoematterâe the dynamics and impact of capitalismâe"not least its tendency to generate economic and political turmoil. Nealon argues persuasively that poetsâe(tm) attention to the matter of capital has created a corresponding notion of poetry as a kind of textual matter, capable of dispersal, retrieval, and disguise in times of crisis. Offering fresh readings of canonical poets from W. H. Auden to Adrienne Rich, as well as interpretations of younger writers like Kevin Davies, The Matter of Capital reorients our understanding of the central poetic project of the last century.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9780674058729', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=rKNTCgZ4miwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=rKNTCgZ4miwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '0674058720', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=rKNTCgZ4miwC&dq=20th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'authors': ['Christopher S.

Bryan, Associate Professor of English, Xavier University of Louisiana Interest in the mother-daughter relationship has never been greater, yet there are few books specifically devoted to the relationships between daughters and mothers of color. To fill that gap, this collection of original essays explores the mother-daughter relationship as it appears in the works of African, African American, Asian American, Mexican American, Native American, Indian, and Australian Aboriginal women writers. Prominent among the writers considered here are Toni Morrison, Alice Walker, Maxine Hong Kingston, Cherrie Moraga, Leslie Marmon Silko, and Amy Tan. Elizabeth Brown-Guillory and the other essayists examine the myths and reality surrounding the mother-daughter relationship in these writers\' works. They show how women writers of color often portray the mother-daughter dyad as a love/hate relationship, in which the mother painstakingly tries to convey knowledge of how to survive in a racist, sexist, and classist world while the daughter rejects her mother\'s experiences as invalid in changing social times. This book represents a further opening of the literary canon to twentieth-century women of color.

Both warships and merchant ships were at risk. In 1914 U-boats demonstrated their capability to sink major warships. During 1915 they turned their attention to merchant ships and began to sink or capture them in wholesale lots. U-boats nearly won the First World War for Germany by forcing Great Britain into peace negotiations in late 1917. U-boats sank or captured over 6,100 ships during WW I. In April 1917 England had only six weeks grain supply left, and apparently had no adequate way to deal with the unrestricted U-boat offensive that Germany unleashed in February of that year.

The quietly beautiful linked stories in Lester Higata’s 20th Century bring us close to people who could be, and should be, our friends and neighbors and families. Starting in 1999 with his conversation with his father, continuing backward in time throughout his life with his wife, Katherine, and their children in Hawai‘i, and ending with his days in the hospital in 1946, as he heals from a wartime wound and meets the woman he will marry, Hamby recreates not just one but any number of the worlds that have shaped Lester. The world of his mother, as stubbornly faithful to Japan and Buddhism as Katherine’s mother is to Ohio and conservative Christianity; the world of his children, whose childhoods and adulthoods are vastly different from his own; the world after Pearl Harbor and Vietnam; the world of a professional engineer and family man: the worlds of Lester Higata’s 20th Century are filled with ordinary people living extraordinary lives, moving from farms to classrooms and offices, from racism to acceptance and even love, all in a setting so paradisal it should be heaven on earth.

It moves away from a simplified view of the Italian industrial structure as just composed by small enterprises and successfully sheds light on the variety of different forms of enterprises the compose Italian system. The lively picture that emerges from this book is the one of richer types of enterprises, which have evolved over time and have contributed in different ways to Italian economic growth. Franco Malerba, Bocconi University, Italy Taking an historical perspective, this unique book highlights the evolution of the many diverse forms of business enterprise, and discusses the contribution of these different types of firm to the economic growth of Italy. One important issue that has recently captured the attention and the research efforts of both economists and economic historians has been the debate on varieties of capitalism in the modern world. In this context, the expert contributors analyze the various stages of Italian development that have been characterized by diverse dominating forms of enterprise which, in turn, have adapted to the nature of technological and market opportunities at the institutional, national and international level. This book proposes a new interpretation of the Italian case that utilizes both the structural and macroeconomic perspective of comparative history, as well as the microeconomic perspectives focusing on the strategies of different economic agents. Based on solid quantitative evidence, this original work will prove to be a valuable resource for academics and students of strategy and organization, economic historians and applied economists.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9781849806565', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=iiGnb-mevnkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=iiGnb-mevnkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '184980656X', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=iiGnb-mevnkC&dq=20th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'authors': ['Andrea Colli', 'Michelangelo Vasta'], 'id': 'iiGnb-mevnkC'}, {'categories': ['Religion'], 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=bj9cJHj3vUwC&dq=20th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'averageRating': 3.5, 'publisher': 'InterVarsity Press', 'subtitle': 'God & the World in a Transitional Age', 'title': '20th-Century Theology', 'description': "Recipient of a Christianity Today 1993 Critics' Choice Award!

Of particular interest is their attempt to show how twentieth-century theology has moved back and forth between two basic concepts: God's immanence and God's transcendence. Their survey profiles such towering figures in contemporary theology as Karl Barth, Rudolf Bultmann, Dietrich Bonhoeffer, Reinhold Niebuhr, Paul Tillich, Jurgen Moltmann and Wolfhart Pannenberg. It critiques significant movements like neo-orthodoxy, process theology, liberation theology and theology of hope. And it assesses recent developments in feminist theology, black theology, new Catholic theology, narrative theology and evangelical theology.

The country has been ravaged by two world wars and the brutal Iran-Iraq War which cost tens of thousands of lives. There was a Constitutional Revolution in 1905-1909 and coups in 1921 and 1953, when Reza Shah and Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi took absolute power, followed by yet another revolution in 1979 when Ayatollah Khomeini proclaimed the Islamic Republic. Wars, revolutions, coups and the impact of modernism have transformed power relations among the political and military elite and have led to radical political, social, cultural, religious and change throughout state and society. These upheavals have shaped Iran’s historiography, just as they have the country’s history. Originally based on oral and written sources, which underpinned traditional genealogical and dynastic history, Iran’s historiography was transformed in the early 20th century with the development of a ‘new’ school of presenting history. Here emphasis shifted from the anecdotal story-telling genre to social, political, economic, cultural and religious history-writing. A new understanding of the nation state and the importance of identity and foreign relations in defining Iran’s place in the modern world all served to transform the perspective of Iranian historiography. Touraj Atabaki here brings together a range of rich contributions from international scholars who cover the leading themes of the historiography of 20th-century Iran, including constitutional reform and revolution, literature and architecture, identity, women and gender, nationalism, modernism, Orientalism, Marxism and Islamism.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9780857731876', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=5qr3AgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=5qr3AgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '0857731874', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=5qr3AgAAQBAJ&dq=20th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'authors': ['Touraj Atabaki'], 'id': '5qr3AgAAQBAJ'}, {'categories': ['Fiction'], 'pageCount': 336, 'averageRating': 3.5, 'publisher': 'Harper Collins', 'title': '20th Century Ghosts', 'description': "Imogene is young, beautiful . . . and dead, waiting in the Rosebud Theater one afternoon in 1945. . . .

I argue that evolutionary theory, along with the Romantic emphasis on sympathy, creates an historical shift in our perception of humans and nonhumans. Beginning with Herman Melville\'s classic novel, Moby-Dick, the whale represents what I call a transitional animal figure in that the whale not only shows the traditionally symbolic literary animal but also the beginnings of the twentieth-century shift toward the literal animal-as-subject. My proposed comparative analysis consists of a return to classic existential and phenomenological philosophers with animal studies in mind. A handful of critical essays in recent years have conducted just such an analysis. My contribution extends these philosophical endeavors on the animal and applies them to major literary authors who demonstrate a notable interest in the philosophy of animals. The first chapter of the dissertation begins with D.H. Lawrence, whose writings in selected essays, St. Mawr, and "The Fox" continue considerations made by Melville concerning animal being. Because Lawrence often focuses on gender, sexuality, and intuition, I discuss how a Heideggerian reading of animals in Lawrence add value to interpretations of his fiction which remain unavailable in analyses of human subjects. In Chapter Two, I move on to William Faulkner\'s classic hunting tale of "The Bear" and other significant animal sightings in his fiction and nonfiction. For Faulkner, the animal subject exists in the author\'s particular historical climate of American environmentalism, modernism\'s literary emphasis on visuality, and race theory. This combination calls for a natural progression from a Heideggerian existential phenomenology: a contemporary Sartrean reading of animal being. Finally, the last chapter examines J.M. Coetzee, an author whose texts show the accumulated existential and phenomenological progression in the philosophy of the animal with a combined interest in current political and social issues surrounding animal life in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries.', 'id': 'er5c01FyL7oC'}, {'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=03Z9Iyhj2PMC&dq=20th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'ISBN_13': '9783640471102', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=03Z9Iyhj2PMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=03Z9Iyhj2PMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '3640471105', 'pageCount': 84, 'publisher': 'GRIN Verlag', 'authors': ['Nadja Klopsch'], 'title': 'The American Dream in 20th Century American Drama', 'description': 'Bachelor Thesis from the year 2008 in the subject American Studies - Literature, grade: 1,7, Ernst Moritz Arndt University of Greifswald (Department of English and American Studies), language: English, abstract: Every year thousands of people from all over the world migrate to the United States of America. For most people escaping war, poverty, ecological destruction and other dangers, the United States constitute a safe harbor where their hopes of a better life come true. Ever since the settling of what is today the US, people came to live in the New World and to lead a better life than in their countries of origin. The hopes connected with this better and happier live are all joined in the concept of the "American Dream," which became one of most powerful creation myths of a country. People migrating to the United States have certain dreams or hopes of a better life but in reality these promises often turn out to be not as strong as people originally believed them to be. Only a very small amount of people achieve the famous idea of "rising from rags to riches" whereas many people fail to attain their goal of a better life. Hence it is not surprising that the American culture not only is shaped by the glorious American Dream but also by the grim truth of its failing or being flunked. Of course, such an important concept deeply influences American culture. Continuously the ideas of the American Dream can be found in television, movies, literature, and arts for instance in F. Scott Fitzgerald\'s The Great Gatsby or Gabriele Muccino\'s film The Pursuit of Happiness. This paper aims to examine the presentment and importance of the American Dream for twentieth century American drama.

Temporal narrowing in form of 20th century was chosen because drama as a literary genre is characterized by experimentation with form and content in this period.

The relationship between the Army and the media is considered in the broader context of the US Government's approach to information management. Given the growing importance of information operations in 21st century warfare, this study provides a succinct overview of how the US Army has approached its relations with the media over the previous century. The study highlights the recurrent tension that exists in both the Army and the US Government's information management writ large. This tension arises from the need for operational security and effective deception and psychological operations and the need to provide transparency to secure public acceptance and support for military operations. The long-running debate over how the Government's information management should be organized and operated reflects this tension. Thus, since World War I a number of bureaucratic manifestations of information management have been tried in wartime, including the Committee on Public Information, the Office of War Information, the Psychological Strategy Board, the United States Information Agency, and, most recently, the Office of Global Communications. With the exception of the United States Information Agency, whose tenure spanned the period from 1953 to 1999, all the other manifestations of bureaucratic information management rose and fell during the wars in which they were created. The growing pains of these organizations sometimes colored the Army's relationship with the media. The need for units in the field to participate in information management is a major challenge for future operations. This study reminds us that those commanders who have gone out of their way to engage the media have, in many cases, had the greatest success with information management.", 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9780982328347', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=TiBLmNFkvksC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=TiBLmNFkvksC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '0982328346', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=TiBLmNFkvksC&dq=20th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'authors': ['Robert T.

On its success or failure seems to hinge the moral fate of the nation and its future citizens. But whether we argue over condom distribution to teenagers or the use of an anti-abortion curriculum in high schools, we rarely question the basic premise--that adolescents need to be educated about sex. How did we come to expect the public schools to manage our children\'s sexuality? More important, what is it about the adolescent that arouses so much anxiety among adults? "Teaching Sex" travels back over the past century to trace the emergence of the "sexual adolescent" and the evolution of the schools\' efforts to teach sex to this captive pupil. Jeffrey Moran takes us on a fascinating ride through America\'s sexual mores: from a time when young men were warned about the crippling effects of masturbation, to the belief that schools could and should train adolescents in proper courtship and parenting techniques, to the reemergence of sexual abstention brought by the AIDS crisis. We see how the political and moral anxieties of each era found their way into sex education curricula, reflecting the priorities of the elders more than the concerns of the young. Moran illuminates the aspirations and limits of sex education and the ability of public authority to shape private behavior.

Also since CESM is a bottom-up approach, all proposed baseline concepts are implicitly volumetrically feasible. System level geometry parameters become fall-outs as opposed to inputs. This is a critical attribute as, without the benefit of experience, a designer would be hard pressed to set the appropriate ranges for such parameters for a vehicle built around a disruptive technology. Furthermore, scaling laws generated from custom data for each concept are subject to less design noise than say, regression based approaches.

Yet, despite this rapid development, the history of this scientific discipline has achieved only recently the status necessary to understand the effects of chemistry on the scientific and technological culture of the modern world. This book addresses the bridging of boundaries between chemistry and the other "classical" disciplines of science, physics and biology as well as the connections of chemistry to mathematics and technology. Chemical research is represented as an interconnected patchwork of scientific specialties, and this is shown by a mixture of case studies and broader overviews on the history of organic chemistry, theoretical chemistry, nuclear- and cosmochemistry, solid state chemistry, and biotechnology. All of these fields were at the center of the development of twentieth century chemistry, and the authors cover crucial topics such as the emergence of new subdisciplines and research fields, the science-technology relationship, and national styles of scientific work. This monograph represents a unique treasure trove for general historians and historians of science, while also appealing to those interested in the theoretical background and development of modern chemistry.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9783527612741', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=gIOK5EUm5ysC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=gIOK5EUm5ysC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '3527612742', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=gIOK5EUm5ysC&dq=20th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'authors': ['Carsten Reinhardt'], 'id': 'gIOK5EUm5ysC'}, {'categories': ['Biography & Autobiography'], 'pageCount': 462, 'publisher': 'Xlibris Corporation', 'subtitle': 'Travels Through the Years', 'title': 'A 20th Century Life', 'description': 'The author recounts his life growing up in a small California town in the 1940´s, serving in the Army and in the U.S. Foreign Service, on to Harvard University and becoming company President.

Since the 1950s thousands of people have lived with 'new' hearts, kidneys, lungs, corneas, and other organs and tissues transplanted into their bodies. From the beginning, though, there was simply a problem: surgeons often encountered shortages of people willing and able to give their organs and tissues. To overcome this problem, they often brokered financial arrangements. Yet an ethic of gift exchange coexisted with the 'commodification of the body'. The same duality characterized the field of blood transfusion, which was essential to the development of modern surgery. This book will be the first to bring together the histories of blood transfusion and organ transplantation. It will show how these two fields redrew the lines between self and non-self, the living and the dead, and humans and animals. Drawing on newspapers, magazines, legal cases, films and the papers and correspondence of physicians and surgeons, Lederer will challenge the assumptions of some bioethicists and policymakers that popular fears about organ transplantation necessarily reflect timeless human concerns and preoccupations with the body. She will show how notions of the body- intact, in parts, living and dead- are shaped by the particular culture in which they are embedded.", 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9780199721917', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=JaZn25Uv6XwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=JaZn25Uv6XwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '0199721912', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=JaZn25Uv6XwC&dq=20th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'authors': ['Susan E.

The modeled temperature difference between the modern and undisturbed landscape is 0.8°C. Using a first-order model of glacier length change, this temperature perturbation is estimated to result in up to 0.66 km of glacier retreat. Over the past few centuries, it has been observed that the large Cascade glaciers have retreated between 2.0 and 2.5 km.

Larger numbers of immigrants are entering the work force, will become part of our aging population, and increasingly, are providing care for the elderly. Family structures and communities are evolving as marriage, childbearing, divorce, and cohabitation trends are changing. The working population that supports the elderly, physically and economically, is also changing and will most likely become smaller and less able to support this growing population. What does this mean for the well-being of our aging population and our efforts to ensure the quality of life for our elderly now and that we will want to enjoy ourselves as we become part of this older population? In this volume Drs. Schaie and Uhlenberg and a host of leading scholars look at the current structure of the American population in an effort to determine the impact it will have on the lives of the elderly and those growing older with disabilities and chronic illness. They examine the effects of the aging baby boomers on health care, migration and immigration and how it can support or tax health care networks, cultural issues regarding access to health care, and changing cultural attitudes towards marriage and family that are affecting the relationships between the elderly and their communities.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9780826101099', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=gIEPMFpA-d8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=gIEPMFpA-d8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '0826101097', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=gIEPMFpA-d8C&dq=20th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'authors': ['K.

The first chapter deals with the mostly very difficult daily life of Chicagoans, their cost of living and the wages they earned at that time; besides that, a passage will be dedicated to people's health conditions. Here, the focus lies on the poorer class of society which to a great extent consisted of immigrants who came to Chicago from all over the U.S. and Europe looking for jobs and hoping for a better life. When reading about the daily life of people it is very likely to come across the name Jane Addams, who helped the poor, and her Hull House. The second chapter is about the means of transport, especially about the importance of the railroad that made it possible for the city to have a great economic growth and provided an access way to the city for the many immigrants arriving in town. Moreover, the invention of the elevated railroad is mentioned and the changes in local transport that resulted from it. In the third chapter, Chicago's development in building is described. Due to the fact that the city was growing very quickly, people needed cheap houses that were easy to build. After the Great Fire of Chicago in 1871, architects from all over the country came to Chicago to rebuild what had been destroyed in the city center. Their greatest innovation was the modern skyscraper. Furthermore, there were two major building projects in Chicago at the turn of the century, the White City for the World's Columbian Exposition in 1893 a", 'id': 'rMrrcfVrtToC'}, {'categories': ['History'], 'pageCount': 352, 'publisher': 'iUniverse', 'subtitle': 'Part Two (1939-1945)', 'title': 'The Effectiveness of Airpower in the 20th Century', 'description': '"This volume ... looks at the air arms of seven nations engaged in [World War II]: France, Germany, Great Britain, Italy, Japan, the USSR and the United States.

Even while violent crime has dropped in recent years, our murder rate is still incredibly high. Since the beginning of the 20th century, our society has undergone profound changes, and our technologies have advanced, but the motives and methods for murder and escaping the long arm of the law have kept pace, often capitalizing on availble technologies. In addition, as the century progressed, the media would become an integral part of murder in America, helping investigations, glamorizing murder, and bringing it into our homes on a daily basis. Here, Scott examines the changing face of murder in the context of societal changes, and traces the advances in investigative techniques and technologies. Each chapter offers vivid accounts of the most notorious and representative murders for each time period, focusing especially on those murderers who have had the edge on their pursuers, even escaping detection to this day. Beginning at the turn of the century, Scott details one of the most notorious cases of the day, in which a jealous lover poisons the wife of her lover. The book ends with the still-unsolved Tupac Shakur murder case. Taking readers through the various developments in methods of murder, and the techniques used to capture the criminals, Scott provides a fascinating overview of the way murder has changed through the decades and how law enforcement has kept pace. This insightful book sheds light on both our fascination with murder and on murderers and their nemeses over the last one hundred years.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9780275999773', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=63Et0WJR_ooC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=63Et0WJR_ooC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '0275999777', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=63Et0WJR_ooC&dq=20th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'authors': ['Gini Graham Scott'], 'id': '63Et0WJR_ooC'}, {'categories': ['Language Arts & Disciplines'], 'pageCount': 316, 'publisher': 'Rodopi', 'subtitle': 'Home, Culture, and Identity in 20th Century French Autobiography', 'title': 'Spaces of Belonging', 'description': "Questions of space, place and identity have become increasingly prominent throughout the arts and humanities in recent times. This study begins by investigating the reasons for this growth in interest and analyses the underlying assumptions on which interdisciplinary discussions about space are often based. After tracing back the history of contact between Geography and Literary Studies from both disciplinary perspectives, it goes on to discuss recent academic work in the field and seeks to forge a new conceptual framework through which contemporary discussions of space and literature can operate. Having argued that the experience of contemporary space has rendered questions of home and belonging particularly pressing, it undertakes detailed analysis of how these phenomena are articulated in a selection of recent French life writing texts. Home is shown to be a deeply problematic, yet strongly desired, element of the contemporary world. The book concludes by addressing the underlying thesis that contemporary life writing might provide just the 'postmodern maps' that could help not only literary scholars, but also geographers, better understand the world today.", 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9789042022836', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Kv1UzrsMLWMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Kv1UzrsMLWMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '9042022833', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=Kv1UzrsMLWMC&dq=20th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'authors': ['Elizabeth Houston Jones'], 'id': 'Kv1UzrsMLWMC'}, {'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=Wy7IQMDN1CEC&dq=20th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'ISBN_13': '9780549683643', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Wy7IQMDN1CEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Wy7IQMDN1CEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '054968364X', 'pageCount': 225, 'publisher': 'ProQuest', 'authors': ['Joseph Fitzpatrick'], 'title': 'Russia Englished: Theorizing Translation in the 20th Century', 'description': 'The second chapter uses the concept of "information" in post-WWII information theory to read Nabokov\'s literal translation of Eugene Onegin, arguing that Nabokov\'s work is designed to enable the reader to mechanistically re-created Pushkin\'s original.

Howard Wettstein's sympathies lie with the critics. But he says that they have often misconceived their critical project, treating it in ways that are technically focused and that miss the deeper implications of their revolutionary challenge. Wettstein argues that Wittgenstein-a figure with whom the critics of Frege and Russell are typically unsympathetic-laid the foundation for much of what is really revolutionary in this late 20th century movement. The subject itself should be of great interest, since philosophy of language has functioned as a kind of foundation for much of 20th century philosophy. But in fact it remains a subject for specialists, since the ideas are difficult and the mode of presentation is often fairly technical. In this book, Wettstein brings the non-specialist into the conversation (especially in early chapters); he also reconceives the debate in a way that avoids technical formulation.

The Falklands/Malvinas War pitted the UK against Argentina in a remote corner of the South Atlantic. Air power allowed a U.K victory, barely. The USSR held air supremacy over Afghanistan but was unable to subdue tough Afghan guerrillas, and was finally forced to withdraw after Stinger missiles were introduced.

The visual qualities of his works, combining the material with the poetic, his wit and irony, are examined in relation to his subtle method of questioning and contradicting, defying conventional systems and definitions. The author explores the wider framing contexts in which things are presented and the geographical context via maps, notions of the voyage and a sense of place.

Considered a mark of the lower class for hundreds of years, tanning became a fad in the early 1920s and remains popular today. The tan, though, was much more thana matter of fashion,enjoying at first a boost from the medical establishment. Opinions ranging from hard science to quackery lauded the suntan as something of a panacea. Near the end of World War II, however, researchers increasingly warned against the hazards of overexposure to the sun, and a large new industry developed--sunscreen. Americans' current paradoxical obsession with the tan developed almost entirely from the conflicting rays of twentieth century thought. This history examines the twentieth century suntan as a social and scientific phenomenon. Beginning with the years 1900-1920, it debunks the myth that changing attitudes toward the tan sprang largely from the world of fashion. Initial pro-tanning medical hype, emerging negative opinions of sunbathing near the middle of the century, the development of sunscreens, the debate over sunscreen efficacy, and the sunless tan are all covered here. Numerous pictures demonstrate changing perceptions of the suntan, displaying advertisements for products that promoted, prevented or healed tans.", 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9780786423941', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=5lGQBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=5lGQBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '0786423943', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=5lGQBQAAQBAJ&dq=20th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'authors': ['Kerry Segrave'], 'id': '5lGQBQAAQBAJ'}, {'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'categories': ['Twentieth century'], 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=_ll27AahUqwC&dq=20th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'ISBN_13': '9780976662600', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_ll27AahUqwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_ll27AahUqwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '0976662604', 'pageCount': 96, 'publisher': 'Probasco Haus Press, LLC', 'authors': ['E.

This approach takes into account competing socialist and nationalist perspectives on language and society to demonstrate the different motivations for and class interest in Irish. The increasing power of the global market has the negative effect of reducing the well-being and autonomy of national populations. The study examines the decline of the Irish language as part of a global neo-liberal system that homogenises markets by reducing national and linguistic boundaries.

Valentino finds that ethnic hatreds or discrimination, undemocratic systems of government, and dysfunctions in society play a much smaller role in mass killing and genocide than is commonly assumed. He shows that the impetus for mass killing usually originates from a relatively small group of powerful leaders and is often carried out without the active support of broader society. Mass killing, in his view, is a brutal political or military strategy designed to accomplish leaders\' most important objectives, counter threats to their power, and solve their most difficult problems. In order to capture the full scope of mass killing during the twentieth century, Valentino does not limit his analysis to violence directed against ethnic groups, or to the attempt to destroy victim groups as such, as do most previous studies of genocide. Rather, he defines mass killing broadly as the intentional killing of a massive number of noncombatants, using the criteria of 50,000 or more deaths within five years as a quantitative standard. Final Solutions focuses on three types of mass killing: communist mass killings like the ones carried out in the Soviet Union, China, and Cambodia; ethnic genocides as in Armenia, Nazi Germany, and Rwanda; and "counter-guerrilla" campaigns including the brutal civil war in Guatemala and the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan.

However, in both conflicts, political constraints prevented the United States from achieving its desired political results, although the 1972 B-52 strategic bombing campaign against Hanoi worked to bring the North Vietnamese back to the negotiating table. The Falklands/Malvinas War pitted the UK against Argentina in a remote corner of the South Atlantic. Air power allowed a U.K victory, barely. The USSR held air supremacy over Afghanistan but was unable to subdue tough Afghan guerrillas, and was finally forced to withdraw after Stinger missiles were introduced. The Gulf War demonstrated the increasing effectiveness of precision aerial weaponry.

Covering over one hundred year from the late 19th century through to the 1990s, the essays in this book examine how both external influences and wills-to-change within Korean society itself generated an artistic vitality against a shifting political, social, and cultural backdrop and how this necessarily involved East Asia at large and the West.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9781856694858', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Ni7dlsUidy0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Ni7dlsUidy0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '1856694852', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=Ni7dlsUidy0C&dq=20th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'authors': ['Yŏng-na Kim'], 'id': 'Ni7dlsUidy0C'}, {'categories': ['Education'], 'pageCount': 242, 'publisher': 'Routledge', 'title': 'Students and University in 20th Century Egyptian Politics', 'description': 'First Published in 1989.

The book provides answers to the most basic questions: What do police do? It reviews how police work is organized, explores the expanding responsibilities of police, examines the increasing diversity among police employees, and discusses the complex interactions between officers and citizens. It also addresses such topics as community policing, use of force, racial profiling, and evaluates the success of common police techniques, such as focusing on crime "hot spots." It goes on to look at the issue of legitimacy-how the public gets information about police work, and how police are viewed by different groups, and how police can gain community trust.

Since 1900 the center of legal gravity in the United States has shifted from the state to the federal government, with the creation of agencies and programs ranging from Social Security to the Securities Exchange Commission to the Food and Drug Administration. Major demographic changes have spurred legal developments in such areas as family law and immigration law. Dramatic advances in technology have placed new demands on the legal system in fields ranging from automobile regulation to intellectual property. Throughout the book, Friedman focuses on the social context of American law. He explores the extent to which transformations in the legal order have resulted from the social upheavals of the twentieth century--including two world wars, the Great Depression, the civil rights movement, and the sexual revolution. Friedman also discusses the international context of American law: what has the American legal system drawn from other countries? And in an age of global dominance, what impact has the American legal system had abroad?

John Braithwaite argues that the competition policies that attack monopolies to ensure vigorous price competition and more efficient production of goods also drive more efficient production of “bads”. Tax avoidance, like any good or service, follows market logic: as the supply increases, so does the demand. Braithwaite makes this argument and explores its implications through a detailed comparative case study of taxation in the United States and Australia. He shows that it is possible to “flip” markets in the vice of tax avoidance to markets in the virtue of tax system integrity. Braithwaite sets out specific regulatory strategies and gives examples of how these might be applied. The result is a blueprint for restoring the equity of Western tax systems and a breakthrough theory of how regulators can support markets in virtue and curtail markets in vice. Markets in Vice, Markets in Virtue is essential reading for anyone involved in policy, governance and regulation. It has profound implications for business, and is of special interest to those working in taxation.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9781862875227', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=zrZxC6DnQhMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=zrZxC6DnQhMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '1862875227', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=zrZxC6DnQhMC&dq=20th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'authors': ['John Braithwaite'], 'id': 'zrZxC6DnQhMC'}, {'categories': ['Performing Arts'], 'pageCount': 380, 'publisher': 'McFarland', 'title': 'Leonide Massine and the 20th Century Ballet', 'description': "The great Russian choreographer Leonide Massine was the most important figure in modernist ballet in the 1930s, known for works such as Gaite Parisienne and The Three-Cornered Hat.

By examining the music and composers, set design, and literary sources, it places the work in the larger context of the dance, opera, major visual art movements, literature and theater of the period. Analyses of ballets include synopses, scenery and costumes, music, choreography, critical survey and summary. The work concludes with an epilogue summarizing Massine's impact on the development of ballet in the twentieth century, and includes both informal and performance photographs.", 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9780786417520', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=RyM8BQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=RyM8BQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '0786417528', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=RyM8BQAAQBAJ&dq=20th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'authors': ['Leslie Norton'], 'id': 'RyM8BQAAQBAJ'}, {'categories': ['History'], 'pageCount': 722, 'averageRating': 3.5, 'publisher': 'Yale University Press', 'title': 'American Law in the 20th Century', 'description': 'American law in the twentieth century describes the explosion of law over the past century into almost every aspect of American life. Since 1900 the center of legal gravity in the United States has shifted from the state to the federal government, with the creation of agencies and programs ranging from Social Security to the Securities Exchange Commission to the Food and Drug Administration. Major demographic changes have spurred legal developments in such areas as family law and immigration law. Dramatic advances in technology have placed new demands on the legal system in fields ranging from automobile regulation to intellectual property. Throughout the book, Friedman focuses on the social context of American law. He explores the extent to which transformations in the legal order have resulted from the social upheavals of the twentieth century--including two world wars, the Great Depression, the civil rights movement, and the sexual revolution. Friedman also discusses the international context of American law: what has the American legal system drawn from other countries? And in an age of global dominance, what impact has the American legal system had abroad? This engrossing book chronicles a century of revolutionary change within a legal system that has come to affect us all.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9780300102994', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=aUNjxn3RvVAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=aUNjxn3RvVAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '0300102992', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=aUNjxn3RvVAC&dq=20th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'authors': ['Lawrence Meir Friedman'], 'id': 'aUNjxn3RvVAC'}, {'categories': ['Reference'], 'pageCount': 399, 'publisher': 'ABC-CLIO', 'subtitle': 'An Encyclopedia', 'title': 'Science in the Early Twentieth Century', 'description': 'The first A–Z resource on the history of science from 1900 to 1950 examining the dynamic between science and the social, political, and cultural forces of the era.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9781851096657', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=mpiZRAiE0JwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=mpiZRAiE0JwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '1851096655', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=mpiZRAiE0JwC&dq=20th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'authors': ['Jacob Darwin Hamblin'], 'id': 'mpiZRAiE0JwC'}, {'categories': ['Medical'], 'pageCount': 318, 'averageRating': 3.0, 'publisher': 'Pharmaceutical Press', 'subtitle': 'A Brief History of Pharmacy and Pharmaceuticals', 'title': 'Making Medicines', 'description': 'Making Medicines is a concise, chronological discussion of the history of therapeutics and pharmacy from the Egyptians through to the present day.

Gedge supports her conclusion with evidence from a wide range of previously untapped primary sources including pastoral manuals, seminary students' and pastors' journals, women's diaries and letters, pamphlets, sentimental and sensational novels, and The Scarlet Letter.", 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9780198029861', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=npm_AYXI8BcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=npm_AYXI8BcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '0198029861', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=npm_AYXI8BcC&dq=20th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'authors': ['Karin E.

In these essays, leading media and cultural theorist Scott Bukatman reveals how popular culture tames the threats posed by technology and urban modernity by immersing people in delirious kinetic environments like those traversed by Plastic Man, Superman, and the careening astronauts of 2001: A Space Odyssey and The Right Stuff. He argues that as advanced technologies have proliferated, popular culture has turned the attendant fear of instability into the thrill of topsy-turvydom, often by presenting images and experiences of weightless escape from controlled space. Considering theme parks, cyberspace, cinematic special effects, superhero comics, and musical films, Matters of Gravity highlights phenomena that make technology spectacular, permit unfettered flights of fantasy, and free us momentarily from the weight of gravity and history, of past and present. Bukatman delves into the dynamic ways pop culture imagines that apotheosis of modernity: the urban metropolis. He points to two genres, musical films and superhero comics, that turn the city into a unique site of transformative power. Leaping in single bounds from lively descriptions to sharp theoretical insights, Matters of Gravity is a deft, exhilarating celebration of the liberatory effects of popular culture.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9780822384892', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=EzYeYuqxnCQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=EzYeYuqxnCQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '0822384892', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=EzYeYuqxnCQC&dq=20th-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'authors': ['Scott Bukatman'], 'id': 'EzYeYuqxnCQC'}, {'categories': ['Philosophy'], 'pageCount': 268, 'publisher': 'A&C Black', 'title': 'German 20th Century Philosophical Writings', 'description': 'Includes: Gunther Anders, "Victims of Aggression"; Hannah Arendt, "From the Life of the Mind"; Ernst Bloch, "On Fine Arts in the Machine Age, From "The Principle of Hope"; Karl Jaspers, "Existential Philosophy"; Albert Schweitzer, "Philosophy of Civilization"; Karl R.

Today’s postmodern armies are expected to provide social-psychological support both to their personnel in military operations abroad and to their families at home. Since the end of the Cold War and even more so after 9/11, separations between military personnel and their families have become more frequent as there has been a multitude of missions carried out by multinational task forces all over the world. The book focuses on three central questions affecting military families. First, how do changing missions and tasks of the military affect soldiers and families? Second, what is the effect of deployments on the ones left behind? Third, what is the national structure of family support systems and its evolution? The book employs a multidisciplinary approach, with contributions from psychology, sociology, history, anthropology and others. In addition, it covers all the services, Army, Navy/Marines, Air Force, spanning a wide range of countries, including UK, USA, Belgium, Turkey, Australia and Japan. At the same time it takes a multitude of perspectives such as the theoretical, empirical, reflective, life events (narrative) approach, national and the global, and uses approaches from different disciplines and perspectives, combining them to produce a volume that enhances our knowledge and understanding of military families.

The subjects of the book concentrate on long-term economic and business issues common to Japan and Germany on the turn of our century.Firstly, both countries experience continuing and interrelated problems in the labor market, budget deficits, demographic changes and the future of the social security system. Secondly, globalization, technical progress and shift of social values lead to structural changes of the economy and its institutions, particularly to deregulations and network economies. As a consequence, new ways of cooperation between firms, customers and suppliers will be established. Thirdly, the network economy changes also the inner structure and management of the companies in both countries including new organizational patterns such as the holding company or the virtual enterprise, the tight cooperation of small and medium-sized companies, human resource management and compensation.Although the broad issues in both countries - as in other mature economies - are essentially the same, the details under the surface are different and therefore ask for different solutions.

Governments are charged with ensuring that this defining event of the 20th century takes its rightful place in the schooling and the historical consciousness of their peoples. The policies and practices of Holocaust education around the world are as diverse as the countries that grapple with its history and its meaning. Educators around the globe struggle to reconcile national histories and memories with the international realities of the Holocaust and its implications for the present. These efforts take place at a time when scholarship about the Holocaust itself has made great strides. In this book, these issues are framed by some of the leading voices in the field, including Elie Wiesel and Yehuda Bauer, and then explored by many distinguished scholars who represent a wide range of expertise. Holocaust education is of such significance, so rich in meaning, so powerful in content, and so diverse in practice that the need for extensive, high-quality empirical research is critical.

The authors draw on rich qualitative and large-scale survey data to explore how couples communicate with each other, negotiate the pressures and pleasures of parenthood, and the vagaries of sexual desire and intimacy across life course. Focusing on 'the everyday', this book unpicks the ordinary and often mundane relationship work that goes into sustaining a relationship over time, breaking down the dichotomy between enduring relationships of quality and good enough or endured relationships.

The rate of change in the academic library, a presence for decades now, has been increasing in the first decade of this century. It is no exaggeration to claim that it is undergoing a top to bottom redefinition. Cataloging and reference remain central to its new role, and the circulation of books is still high though declining. Among the changes is the architecture of the library: when new libraries replace old or where renovation is occurring; the role of technology at every stage and in every library application; the management of serials – selection, shelving and budgeting; and in a gradual but irrevocable move to digital forms, altered allocation of resources including larger portions of the budget diverted to preservation, not only of aging books, a theme in the latter part of the last century, but of digital files – cultural, historical, personal. In brief, the academic library is dramatically different today than it was only ten years ago. And with it, the profession of the academic librarian is also undergoing significant changes. Managing digital resources in all its forms, from telecommunications to storage and access devices, is central to its new roles. Creating, curating and preserving digital information is also key to the new librarianship. And what about services to its clients? Here also we see dramatic change, particularly but not exclusively with guiding library users in the effective use of networked knowledge. Information literacy is a key term and skill in using the new tools of digital literacy: reading and writing, searching and extracting; and the new technologies that drive social networking – the Iphone, Ipad, and Ipod and its many imitators. We can’t expect the redefined academic library to assume its final shape any time soon, if ever, but the transformation is well underway. This series: Creating the 21st-Century Academic Library, will explore this topic from a number of different perspectives. Volume 1, Visionary Leadership and Futures, will begin the discussion by examining some of the new roles and directions academic libraries are taking.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9781442245778', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=u7n0BgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=u7n0BgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '1442245778', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=u7n0BgAAQBAJ&dq=21st-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'authors': ['Bradford Lee Eden'], 'id': 'u7n0BgAAQBAJ'}, {'categories': ['Education'], 'pageCount': 216, 'publisher': 'Springer', 'subtitle': 'A Socio-Cultural Perspective', 'title': 'New Media and Learning in the 21st Century', 'description': 'This volume brings together conceptualizations and empirical studies that explore the socio-cultural dimension of new media and its implications on learning in the 21st century classroom. The authors articulate their vision of new-media-enhanced learning at a global level. The high-level concept is then re-examined for different degrees of contextualization and localization, for example how a specific form of new media (e-reader) changes specific activities in different cultures. In addition, studies based in Singapore classrooms provide insights as to how these concepts are being transformed and implemented by a co-constructive effort on the part of researchers, teachers and students. Singapore classrooms offer a unique environment to study the theory-practice nexus in that they are high achieving, implicitly grounded in the eastern cultural values and well-equipped with ICT infrastructure. While these studies are arguably the state-of-the-art exemplars that synergize socio-cultural and technological affordances of the current learning environments, they also serve as improvable ideas for further innovations. The interplay between theory and practice lends support to the reciprocal improvements for both.

Sims was at the forefront of naval affairs. From the revolution in naval gunnery that he led as a junior officer, to his advocacy for the Dreadnaught style all-big-gun battleship, to his development of torpedo boat and destroyer operations, he was a central figure in helping to prepare the U.S. Navy for World War I. During the war he served as the senior naval commander in Europe and was instrumental in the establishment of the convoy system that won the Battle of the Atlantic. Following the war his leadership as President of the Naval War College established the foundations of the creative and innovative Navy that would develop the operating concepts for submarines and aircraft carriers which would lead to success in World War II. Despite his dramatic impact on the U.S. Navy in the first half of the 20th century, Sims is a relatively unknown figure today. Overshadowed in our memory by the World War II generation of strategic Admirals, like Chester Nimitz and Raymond Spruance, he receives little attention from historians or professional naval officers. Despite the fact that he won a Pulitzer Prize for history, hardly anyone reads the books or articles he left as his legacy. This collection of six essays written by Sims illustrates why his thinking and leadership are relevant to the challenges faced in the 21st century. From the perils of military conservatism, to the responsibilities of the professional officer, to military downsizing and reform, he helped lay the foundations of the modern Navy. Armstrong’s introductions and analysis of these essays links them directly to the issues of innovation, professional education, and leadership that are as important at the start of this century as they were at the start of the last.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9781612518091', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=36EvBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=36EvBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '1612518095', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=36EvBgAAQBAJ&dq=21st-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'authors': ['Benjamin Armstrong'], 'id': '36EvBgAAQBAJ'}, {'categories': ['Music'], 'pageCount': 260, 'publisher': 'Rowman & Littlefield', 'subtitle': 'An Introduction', 'title': 'Tonal Counterpoint for the 21st-Century Musician', 'description': 'Written in a style that is clear, simple, and informal writing style, Davidian artfully mixes the history of counterpoint with an outline of its structure, placing musical examples from J.

While the basic principles of the technique have remained unchanged, those working with Point and Figure must still push the boundaries of how it is used, looking to make it even more insightful and powerful. This is exactly what Jeremy du Plessis has achieved with 21st Century Point and Figure. Previously, it was thought that the lack of time on Point and Figure charts meant that time-based tools and indicators could not be used, and lack of volume meant that the importance of individual columns could not be determined. Jeremy du Plessis shows definitively that neither is the case and that with the use of lateral thinking there are also a host of other new techniques that can be added to Point and Figure charts and analysis. In this advanced practical guide, du Plessis explains: - How to use moving averages, Bollinger bands, Donchian channels and parabolic stop and reverse with Point and Figure charts. - How time-based indicators such as overbought/oversold, RSI, directional movement and MACD can be used with Point and Figure charts. - How column volume can be used to assess a column's strength and how volume at box level can be used to assess support and resistance areas. - How traditional accumulation distribution lines, such as on-balance volume and volume-price trend, can be used to enhance the reading of the chart. - How the analysis of relative strength and spreads can be enhanced using these new techniques. - Two new Point and Figure based market breadth indicators. Finally, he introduces a new Point and Figure based oscillator that can also be used on time-based charts. All topics are illustrated with numerous high-quality, full colour charts and observations from years of trading experience. The techniques described here open up a whole world of new and advanced analysis tools. You will see that there is more to Point and Figure than you ever imagined, and that it is more flexible than has ever been realised before. If you employ Point and Figure analysis, ensure you don't miss out on these powerful new techniques - be sure to bring your analysis into the 21st century.", 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9780857194619', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=-MZuBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=-MZuBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '0857194615', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=-MZuBgAAQBAJ&dq=21st-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'authors': ['Jeremy du Plessis'], 'id': '-MZuBgAAQBAJ'}, {'categories': ['Political Science'], 'pageCount': 392, 'publisher': 'Palgrave Macmillan', 'title': 'Comparative Civil Service Systems in the 21st Century', 'description': 'In recent decades civil service systems have been subject to intense scrutiny and their role brought into question.

The conference, themed "The Anthropology of Africa: Challenges for the 21st Century", was attended by some seventy participants, mostly African. Among the international participants was Dr Sydel Silverman, President of the Wenner Gren Foundation at the time - a long term partner of the PAAA; she was present at the inaugural conference in 1988. The conference proceedings were initially published in 2000 with very limited circulation. Given the continued relevance of the papers presented, and in view of the call by the President of the PAAA for African anthropologists to reunite anthropological theory and practice in the teaching programmes of African universities, the PAAA is pleased to republish the proceedings of its landmark 9th Annual Conference. The book consists of forty three divided into eight parts, namely: i) teaching anthropology in the decades ahead; ii) Health Challenges: HIV/AIDS Anthropological Perspectives; iii) NGOS: Use and Misuse of Anthropology; iv) Anthropological Focus on Environment; v) Some Applied Issues in Anthropology; vi) The African Family in Crisis; vii) Ethnicity and Ethnic Conflicts; and viii) Population issues and anthropology: Fertility Crisis.

Book Banning in 21st-Century American Libraries, based on thirteen contemporary book challenge cases in schools and public libraries across the United States argues that understanding contemporary reading practices, especially interpretive strategies, is vital to understanding why people attempt to censor books in schools and public libraries. Previous research on censorship tends to focus on legal frameworks centered on Supreme Court cases, historical case studies, and bibliographies of texts that are targeted for removal or relocation and is often concerned with how censorship occurs. The current project, on the other hand, is focused on the why of censorship and posits that many censorship behaviors and practices, such as challenging books, are intimately tied to the how one understands the practice of reading and its effects on character development and behavior. It discusses reading as a social practice that has changed over time and encompasses different physical modalities and interpretive strategies. In order to understand why people challenge books, it presents a model of how the practice of reading is understood by challengers including “what it means” to read a text, and especially how one constructs the idea of “appropriate” reading materials. The book is based on three different kinds sources. The first consists of documents including requests for reconsideration and letters, obtained via Freedom of Information Act requests to governing bodies, produced in the course of challenge cases. Recordings of book challenge public hearings constitute the second source of data. Finally, the third source of data is interviews with challengers themselves. The book offers a model of the reading practices of challengers. It demonstrates that challengers are particularly influenced by what might be called a literal “common sense” orientation to text wherein there is little room for polysemic interpretation (multiple meanings for text). That is, the meaning of texts is always clear and there is only one avenue for interpretation. This common sense interpretive strategy is coupled with what Cathy Davidson calls “undisciplined imagination” wherein the reader is unable to maintain distance between the events in a text and his or her own response. These reading practices broaden our understanding of why people attempt to censor books in public institutions.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9781442231689', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=C_Q1BgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=C_Q1BgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '1442231688', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=C_Q1BgAAQBAJ&dq=21st-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'authors': ['Emily J.

At the same time, contemporary power rivalries are increasingly affected by currency wars, economic diplomacy, competitive intelligence, economic warfare, indirect strategies, and state capitalism. The events in Ukraine in Spring 2014 reconfirm that Thomas Friedman’s flattening of the world (based on the coincidence of the collapse of the Berlin Wall and the emergence of Netscape and the Web; workflow software; uploading; outsourcing; offshoring; supply-chaining; insourcing; in-forming; and “steroids” like Facebook and Instagram) goes hand in hand with the fact that, as postulated by Robert Kaplan, geography still matters in a global world. Globalization exists because of local processes, and local processes are ultimately shaped by globalization. Geography remains among the primary factors shaping a country’s foreign policy. This book addresses the most fundamental geopolitical issues observable in a region where the “great game” of geopolitics is particularly still alive – in East- and South-East Asia. The contemporary geopolitical situation in this part of the world is far from stable: the width and depth of economic integration in the region resonates with the nature of political relations, crises in the global financial system, climate change, and the regional security architecture inherited from the Cold-War era. In terms of power relations, the particular changes in the region’s status quo imply an immediate intensification of the PRC’s activities within the framework of political and security dialogue with its direct neighbors, ultimately leading to a rivalry between China and the United States. The studies presented in this book largely focus on East- and South-East Asian actors and problems, while studies of the situation in other global regions enrich the research by adding a global dimension to the study of regional geopolitical affairs.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9781443871341', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=vOumBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=vOumBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '1443871346', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=vOumBgAAQBAJ&dq=21st-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'authors': ['Martin Riegl', 'Jakub Landovský', 'Irina Valko'], 'id': 'vOumBgAAQBAJ'}, {'categories': ['Mathematics'], 'pageCount': 239, 'publisher': 'Springer', 'subtitle': '6th World Conference, Lahore, March 2013', 'title': 'Mathematics in the 21st Century', 'description': 'Numerous well-presented and important papers from the conference are gathered in the proceedings for the purpose of pointing directions for useful future research in diverse areas of mathematics including algebraic geometry, analysis, commutative algebra, complex analysis, discrete mathematics, dynamical systems, number theory and topology.

That’s what Roger Bourke White Jr. calls a “goat sacrifice”— it’s a tradeoff that doesn’t do what it is intended to do: solve the problem. These sacrifices make people and communities feel less guilty and fearful, but do nothing to end the serious problems. Examples of modern goat sacrificing include searching all air passengers so we’ll feel safe, striving to protect our children so much they can’t play outside, and criminalizing large segments of the population for drug-related activities so we feel like we’re fighting drug abuse. These solutions cost huge amounts of money and attention, but they do nothing to solve problems. Even worse, they include unseen costs beyond the obvious goat that distracts us from finding true, lasting solutions. It’s important to study why goat sacrifices occur, how to identify when we’re wasting money, so we can instead spend those dollars well. We can do all of those things by getting smart about good intentions and recognizing Goat Sacrificing in the 21st Century.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9781496945600', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=5EiFBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=5EiFBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '1496945603', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=5EiFBQAAQBAJ&dq=21st-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'authors': ['Roger Bourke White Jr.'], 'id': '5EiFBQAAQBAJ'}, {'categories': ['Business & Economics'], 'pageCount': 272, 'averageRating': 3.0, 'publisher': 'Author House', 'title': 'Goat Sacrificing in the 21st Century', 'description': "Millions of people want to Save the Planet from human-caused catastrophe, and millions more want to Save Humanity from poverty and poor health.

The major elements of this new volume are the identification and description of two 21st century skills that are amenable to teaching and learning: collaborative problem solving, and learning in digital networks. Features of the skills that need to be mirrored in their assessment are identified so that they can be reflected in assessment tasks. The tasks are formulated so that reporting of student performance can guide implementation in the classroom for use in teaching and learning. How simple tasks can act as platforms for development of 21st century skills is demonstrated, with the concurrent technical infrastructure required for its support. How countries with different languages and cultures participated and contributed to the development process is described. The psychometric qualities of the online tasks developed are reported, in the context of the robustness of the automated scoring processes.

The first contemporary volume on the subject, Family Formation in 21st Century Australia chronicles significant changes in partnering and fertility. In the late 20th century, cohabitation, divorce and births outside marriage rose dramatically. Yet family formation patterns continue to evolve, requiring fresh analysis. Even since the turn of the century, divorce has stabilized and fertility has increased. Using information from the 2011 Australian Census and from large-scale surveys, leading Australian academics dissect recent trends in cohabitation, ‘living apart together’, marriage, interethnic partnering, relationship dissolution, repartnering, contraceptive use and fertility.

These developments have not only influenced political and economic discussions in the 21st century, but also raise new questions on the role of taxation in the economic policy environment. National taxation systems worldwide are subject to significant changes and it is assumed that they will develop in a more co-operative way in the near future. This book aims at identifying the major developments in tax policy in the 21st century on a national as well as on an international level and gives an in-depth analysis of the challenges and risks, but also of the opportunities connected to these developments. Ist covers numerous and discrete issues ranging from challenges in the VAT/GST area, the taxation of the financial sector, the fight against aggressive tax planning, tax abuse and tax evasion, tax integration within the EU, the development of transfer pricing rules, the increasing role of co-operative compliance and good governance and the changing tax policies of developing and newly industrialized countries.

Themes of current interest include ethics, gender balance, education, workplace preparation, communication, competencies, and the future of engineering. Original and thought-provoking articles on these themes are presented by authors who have achieved international recognition for their work in engineering research, practice and education, and who work in different capacities in industry or higher education around the world. Recognizing the pluralism that is characteristic of such themes, each chapter presents two articles reflecting distinct perspectives and contexts. This volume therefore provides ideal opportunities for readers who wish to develop their critical thinking capacities by contrasting and evaluating the different viewpoints. It also provides readers with writing that complements the technical discourse predominant in engineering workplaces and institutes. This book, therefore, while promoting professional literacy and thinking skills development, concurrently serves to cultivate the well-rounded and forward-looking engineers required by the international community to meet the multifaceted challenges of 21st century engineering.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9781443868358', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=5CtQBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=5CtQBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '1443868353', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=5CtQBwAAQBAJ&dq=21st-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'authors': ['Caroline Brandt', 'David Prescott'], 'id': '5CtQBwAAQBAJ'}, {'categories': ['Religion'], 'pageCount': 414, 'publisher': 'Wipf and Stock Publishers', 'subtitle': 'Trends in Contemporary Theology', 'title': 'Theologies of the 21st Century', 'description': 'What theologies are popular and formative of Christian thinking in the present day?

The book examines markets in seven countries and three different U.S. states, ranging from village-level water markets in Oman to basin wide formal water markets in Australia's Murray-Darling River basin. Introductory chapters on the background of water markets and on transaction costs and policy design are followed by chapter length discussion of water markets as an adaptive response to climate change and of supply reliability in a changing climate. Case studies describe a variety of facets of the design and function of markets around the world: California, Chile, Spain, Oman, Australia, Canada, India and China. In analyzing these real-world examples of markets, the contributors explore water rights and trading of rights between agricultural and urban sectors and the principles and function of option markets. They discuss different sized approaches, from large scale, ministry-level administration of markets to informal arrangements among farmers in the same village, or groups of villages which allocate water without large investment in management and infrastructure. Discussion includes questions of why water market practices have not expanded more rapidly in arid places. The book discusses mechanisms for resolving conflicts between water rights holders as well as between water right holders and third parties impacted by water trades and whether or not public ownership of water rights or use rights should trump private ownership and under what condition. Also covered are new and expanding categories of water use, beyond human consumption, agriculture and industry to new technologies ranging from extracting natural gas from shale to producing biofuels. The book concludes with suggestions for future water markets and offers a realistic picture of how they might change water use and distribution practices going forward.", 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9789401790819', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=CvcsBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=CvcsBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '9401790817', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=CvcsBAAAQBAJ&dq=21st-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'authors': ['K.

From MoveOn.org to the National Rifle Association, Health Care for America Now to the Sierra Club, membership-based civic associations constantly seek to engage people in civic and political action. What makes some more effective than others? Using in-person observations, surveys, and field experiments, this book compares organizations with strong records of engaging people in health and environmental politics to those with weaker records. To build power, civic associations need quality and quantity (or depth and breadth) of activism. They need lots of people to take action and also a cadre of leaders to develop and execute that activity. Yet, models for how to develop activists and leaders are not necessarily transparent. This book provides these models to help associations build the power they want and support a healthy democracy. In particular, the book examines organizing, mobilizing, and lone wolf models of engagement and shows how highly active associations blend mobilizing and organizing to transform their members' motivations and capacities for involvement. This is not a simple story about the power of offline versus online organizing. Instead, it is a story about how associations can blend both online and offline strategies to build their activist base. In this compelling book, Hahrie Han explains how civic associations can invest in their members and build the capacity they need to inspire action.", 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9780199336784', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Y2W8AwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Y2W8AwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '0199336784', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=Y2W8AwAAQBAJ&dq=21st-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'authors': ['Hahrie Han'], 'id': 'Y2W8AwAAQBAJ'}, {'categories': ['Social Science'], 'pageCount': 304, 'publisher': 'Palgrave Macmillan', 'subtitle': 'Theory and Practice in International Perspective', 'title': 'Corporate Security in the 21st Century', 'description': 'This interdisciplinary collection places corporate security in a theoretical and global context.

The first part of this book explores the innovative approach of social responsible investors in building engagement approaches, mobilizing networks, developing new products, and proposing alternative models showing the potential to create change. The second part interrogates the limits of SRI in making a difference. It questions the potential of SRI to create change but also proposes ways to increase societal impacts of SRI.

Everything God does is by his Holy Spirit, his power and the gospel. The Holy Spirit touches people by His presence and power. In 21st Century Ministry, like the days of Jesus Christ and the apostles (1st Century) people need to know the Holy Spirit and the word of God.

The 21st Century is special time for the ministry of God to the people. In 21st Century Ministry, you will realize five points for the ministry of God to the people of the world, in the day that we are living. • Ministry Source: Jesus Christ is the source of the ministry. • Ministry and Church: people must find ministry in the church. • A to Z of the Ministry of God: these are ministry insights in alphabetical order. • Ministry Reference: all key terms to do with ministry are explained from Bible. • How to minister to a person: you will learn divine ways to minister to a person.

In 21st Century, the time has come to serve God and minister to people by the Holy Spirit and the word. In this present world both sinners and saints need the ministry of the Holy Spirit and the word of God.

This precarious environment jeopardizes security at the societal, community and individual levels. In a globalized and interconnected world, millions of people worldwide are affected by some form of human insecurity. Infectious and parasitic diseases annually kill millions.

In Zambia 1 million people in a population of 11 million are reported to be HIV-positive, a situation much worse in other countries. Potable water crisis looms almost everywhere.

The church at Ephesus is today's model of strong church. Paul started the church at Ephesus with great ministry and open doors for the gospel. The church at Ephesus was strong because of the Holy Spirit, Prayer, the Word of God, Faith and the Name of Jesus Christ. After Paul went to be with the Lord and all other witnesses of Jesus Christ and ministers of the word, many churches became weak and they lost their strength and impact. But the church at Ephesus continued to be strong in the Lord and in the ministry. The apostle Paul left a young minister and witness, Timothy continued His ministry. Timothy is respected and recognized as a pastor of the church at Ephesus. Timothy was instructed by pastoral Epistles of Paul (1 and 2 Timothy). Timothy was servant of the Lord Jesus Christ, as a key pastor of this great church. The gift of ministry in his life, he received it by prophecy through the laying on of hands by presbytery. The aim to write this book: 21st Century Church, is to strengthen the people of God. Do not be weak, but be strong in the Lord and in the ministry. God has given you the gift of ministry. Be strong in your gift and serve the Lord Jesus Christ. The Lord Jesus Christ who is strong in power and grace is able to strengthen you in all things. In reading 21st Century Church, you will learn about: Jesus Christ and Church, Sound Ministry, Dynamic Holy Spirit, Divine Word and Strong Church. As you read my book on Church strength, may you find strength on your spirit, soul and body. May you be strong in the Lord. May your church also be strong.

Despite the recent focus on Brazil, India, and particularly China, the European Union remains the world's largest market and trader. Despite its recent economic troubles, Europe remains in a powerful position to shape how globalization is governed. We know surprisingly little about how its trade policy is actually made, because previous works have focused on individual trade policy decisions to the detriment of the 'big picture' of the Union as a trade power. Parochial Global Europe argues that trade policy is composed of multiple, distinct policies. Each presents a distinctive constellation of mobilized societal preferences, pattern of political institutions, and range of government preferences. The balance of economic power between the EU and its trade partner(s) affects the stakes involved. Together these four factors define trade policy sub-systems, which help explain both the EU's objectives and whether it realizes them. The authors advance this argument by analysing the EU's role in the demise of the Doha Round, its use of anti-dumping and pursuit of market access, the trade effects of its single market programme and efforts at regulatory diplomacy, including the launch of the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership negotiations. Parochial Global Europe thus focuses centrally on modern, 21st century trade policy. It also sheds light on the EU as a global actor by analysing its use of trade policy as a tool of foreign policy from promoting development, to encouraging human rights and environmental protection, to punishing security threats.", 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9780191017094', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=C49tAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=C49tAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '0191017094', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=C49tAwAAQBAJ&dq=21st-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'authors': ['Alasdair R.

The authors ofOn Limited Nuclear War in the 21st Century argue that a time may come when one of these states makes the conscious decision that using a nuclear weapon against the United States, its allies, or forward deployed forces in the context of a crisis or a regional conventional conflict may be in its interests. They assert that we are unprepared for these types of limited nuclear wars and that it is urgent we rethink the theory, policy, and implementation of force related to our approaches to this type of engagement. Together they critique Cold War doctrine on limited nuclear war and consider a number of the key concepts that should govern our approach to limited nuclear conflict in the future. These include identifying the factors likely to lead to limited nuclear war, examining the geopolitics of future conflict scenarios that might lead to small-scale nuclear use, and assessing strategies for crisis management and escalation control. Finally, they consider a range of strategies and operational concepts for countering, controlling, or containing limited nuclear war.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9780804790918', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=h_30AgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=h_30AgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '0804790914', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=h_30AgAAQBAJ&dq=21st-century&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'authors': ['Jeffrey Larsen', 'Kerry Kartchner'], 'id': 'h_30AgAAQBAJ'}, {'categories': ['Education'], 'pageCount': 367, 'publisher': 'Cambridge Scholars Publishing', 'subtitle': 'Quality Education for Quality Teaching', 'title': 'The Teacher of the 21st Century', 'description': 'The Association for Teacher Education in Europe (ATEE) is a non-profit European organisation, aimed at enhancing the quality of Teacher Education in Europe, and supporting the professional development of teachers and teacher educators at all levels.

The author helps teachers to recognize the mathematical learning that occurs during play, to develop strategies for mathematizing that play, and to design formal lessons that make connections between mathematics and play. Common Core State Standards are addressed throughout the text to demonstrate the ways in which play is critical to standards-based mathematics teaching, and to help teachers become more familiar with these standards. Classroom examples illustrate that, unlike most formal tasks, play offers children opportunities to solve nonroutine problems and to demonstrate a variety of mathematical ways of thinking—such as perseverance and attention to precision. This book will help put play back into the early childhood classroom where it belongs. Book Features: Makes explicit connections to play and the Common Core State Standards in Mathematics. Offers many examples of free play activities in which mathematics can be highlighted, as well as formal lessons that are inspired by play. Provides strategies for making assessments more playful, helping teachers meet increasing demands for assessment data while also reducing child stress. Includes highlight boxes with recommended resources, questions for reflection, key research findings, vocabulary, lesson plan templates, and more. “This is one of those books that I wish I had written. It is smart, readable, relevant, and authentically focused on children.” —From the Foreword by Elizabeth Graue, Sorenson Professor of Early Childhood Education, University of Wisconsin “In this deceptively easy-to-read book, Amy Parks explains two things that could make a world of difference in early childhood and elementary classrooms: Mathematics isn’t something in a workbook—it’s a fascinating part of the real world; And playing in school isn’t a luxury—it’s an essential context for learning about all sorts of things, including mathematics. Through vignettes of children learning mathematics as they play, Parks helps teachers recognize their ‘answerability to the moment,’ eschewing someone else’s determination of ‘best practice’ in favor of what works with actual children eager to learn mathematics.” —Rebecca New, School of Education, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9780807773475', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=vunDBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=vunDBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '0807773476', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=vunDBQAAQBAJ&dq=2nd-grade&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'authors': ['Amy Noelle Parks'], 'id': 'vunDBQAAQBAJ'}, {'categories': ['Education'], 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=gKdDAwAAQBAJ&dq=2nd-grade&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'averageRating': 3.0, 'publisher': 'Teachers College Press', 'subtitle': 'Closing the Rich/Poor Reading Achievement Gap', 'title': 'Summer Reading', 'description': 'Summer reading loss accounts for roughly 80% of the rich/poor reading achievement gap. Yet far too little attention is given to this pressing problem. This timely volume now offers not only a comprehensive review of what is known about summer reading loss but also provides reliable interventions and guidance. Written by acknowledged experts and researchers on reading, remedial reading, and special education, this collection describes multiple models of innovative summer reading and book distribution initiatives. It also provides research-based guidelines for planning a successful summer reading program, including tips on book selection, distribution methods, and direction for crucial follow-up. Most important, the authors clearly show how schools and communities can see greater academic gains for students from low-income families using the methods described in this book than from much more costly interventions.

Lindsay, Anne McGill-Franzen, Geraldine Melosh, Lunetta Williams “Summer Reading shows us how to make voluntary reading programs work, especially for low-achievers. This could be the foundation of a reform movement that stands a chance of closing the achievement gap between rich and poor that haunts American schools.” —P.

Practicing sentence development is a fundamental key to becoming an excellent writer. This 2nd Grade Writing Journal can be used in conjunction with ready-made story-starters. It can also be used daily as a tool by student writers to record their activities, adventures, and imaginative thoughts.Journals can help students clarify their thoughts. Taking time to jot down feelings and thoughts about daily events can give young writers an opportunity to discover what they think and how they feel about different topics. Writing in a journal is comfortable for beginning writers because it is a casual and informal process. It isn\'t structured or graded. Students are allowed to free-write and become immersed in expression. Students should be allowed to write about different topics, which will give them the opportunity to improve their writing skills while exploring their thoughts without being chastised for grammar, usage, or other errors.

However, to truly engage students in worthwhile, rigorous cognition, a profound shift is necessary: a shift in emphasis from teaching to learning. Put another way, we know that whoever is doing the work is also doing the learning—and in most classrooms, teachers are working much too hard. Authors John V. Antonetti and James R. Garver are the designers of the Look 2 Learning model of classroom walkthroughs. They\'ve visited more than 17,000 classrooms—examining a variety of teaching and learning conditions, talking to students, examining their work, and determining their levels of thinking and engagement. From this vast set of data, they\'ve drawn salient lessons that provide valuable insight into how to smooth the transition from simply planning instruction to designing high-quality student work. The lessons John and Jim have learned from their 17,000 (and counting) classroom visits can\'t be wrong. They share those lessons in this book, along with stories of successful practice and practical tools ready for immediate classroom application. The authors also provide opportunities for reflection and closure designed to help you consider (or reconsider) your current beliefs and practices.

But he was lucky enough to be raised in a loving family, the power of that love reflected throughout his stories. The day when boys would have cell phones, television, smart phones, and Ipads was in the far distant future. Boys made do with what they had--old tires, bottle caps, marbles, spools, and anything else they could find around the house, forcing them to be inventive in their play. It was a period when milkmen delivered milk in bottles, icemen brought blocks of ice for the ice box, and the sound of steam locomotives echoed through the town.

New for this edition includes; a new preface and a new introduction that discusses the CCSS and their implications for literature instruction; lists of nonficiton texts at the end of each chapter related to the critical lens described in that chapter; a new chapter on new historicism, a critical lens uniquely suited to interpreting nonfiction and informational sources; new classroom activities created and field-tested specifically for use with nonfiction texts, and additional activities that demonstrate how informational texts can be used in conjunction with traditional literary texts.', 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9780807756232', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=U8EcBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=U8EcBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '0807756237', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=U8EcBgAAQBAJ&dq=2nd-grade&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'authors': ['Deborah Appleman'], 'id': 'U8EcBgAAQBAJ'}, {'categories': ['Medical'], 'pageCount': 426, 'publisher': 'Springer', 'title': 'Essential Imaging in Rheumatology', 'description': 'Essentials of Rheumatology Imaging covers all current methods of imaging and imaging techniques related to common rheumatic symptoms and specific rheumatic diseases.

Reviews Independent customer reviews of our Spelling resources can be found in the Save Teachers Sundays store on TeachersPayTeachers.com and on SaveTeachersSundays.com. Further detail on the features of the book can be found below: Structure of each page Each page is designed to cover a single grapheme / spelling pattern and begins with a 'Teaching Tip' which explains the spelling rule being covered on that page (if there is a spelling rule). Children are then presented with a list of words to learn that follow the relevant spelling rule. Each word is given in a sentence to help the children to understand what the word means. Multisensory Children are encouraged to say the letters aloud as they spell (auditory) and to join the letters (kinaesthetic). The online games also allow children to learn the spellings by seeing them, by hearing audio of them and by typing them. Learning spellings in a multisensory way gives children the best chance of remembering them. Multisensory methods are also widely accepted as being most effective for dyslexic children. Spelling rules explained at the top of each page (if there is a rule) This helps children to apply the rule to other words too, not just to the specific words on the page. Irregular words are highlighted in red, with the irregular letters underlined This prevents children from generalizing incorrectly from irregular words and draws their attention to the tricky letters. Pen lifts after each syllable Breaking longer words into syllables helps children to spell them. Encouraging self-checking Children checking their own work for errors makes them more likely to remember these and is less damaging for their self-esteem than adult correction.", 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9781503216723', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=MfyyrQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=MfyyrQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '1503216721', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=MfyyrQEACAAJ&dq=2nd-grade&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'authors': ['Raymond Rodgers', 'Dave Hopper', 'Alison Kennedy'], 'id': 'MfyyrQEACAAJ'}, {'categories': ['Education'], 'pageCount': 222, 'publisher': 'CreateSpace', 'subtitle': 'Common Core State Standards', 'title': 'Pennsylvania 2nd Grade Math Test Prep', 'description': "Our Pennsylvania 2nd Grade Math Test Prep for Common Core State Standards is an excellent resource to assess and manage student's understanding of concepts outlined in the Common Core State Standards Initiative.

Research shows that when teachers think more about questioning - deepening their understanding, extending their range of strategies and planning their questions - responses from pupils improve, and engagement and learning increase. This Pocketbook separates out the three elements of questioning: framing them; delivering them; and responding to the answers. It offers both simple tweaks and fundamental shifts to turn instinctive practice into a highly effective teaching and learning tool. Author and \'question master\' Gorden Pope finds a happy balance between theory and evidence-based practice, ending with a short checklist for monitoring and improving your own questioning.

Today's classroom is more diverse, more inclusive, and more plugged into technology than ever before. And it's led by teachers under enormous pressure to help decidedly unstandardized students meet an expanding set of rigorous, standardized learning targets. In this updated second edition of her best-selling classic work, Carol Ann Tomlinson offers these teachers a powerful and practical way to meet a challenge that is both very modern and completely timeless: how to divide their time, resources, and efforts to effectively instruct so many students of various backgrounds, readiness and skill levels, and interests. With a perspective informed by advances in research and deepened by more than 15 years of implementation feedback in all types of schools, Tomlinson explains the theoretical basis of differentiated instruction, explores the variables of curriculum and learning environment, shares dozens of instructional strategies, and then goes inside elementary and secondary classrooms in nearly all subject areas to illustrate how real teachers are applying differentiation principles and strategies to respond to the needs of all learners. This book's insightful guidance on what to differentiate, how to differentiate, and why lays the groundwork for bringing differentiated instruction into your own classroom or refining the work you already do to help each of your wonderfully unique learners move toward greater knowledge, more advanced skills, and expanded understanding. Today more than ever, The Differentiated Classroom is a must-have staple for every teacher's shelf and every school's professional development collection.", 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'ISBN_13': '9781416618638', 'imageLinks': {'thumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=0xJRBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'smallThumbnail': 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=0xJRBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'}, 'ISBN_10': '1416618635', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=0xJRBAAAQBAJ&dq=2nd-grade&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api', 'authors': ['Carol Ann Tomlinson'], 'id': '0xJRBAAAQBAJ'}]
